# Changes between versions

This file documents all changes made between versions of the benchmark which affect the results.

In general, we follow a semantic versioning approach:
- The **major** number changes when new games are added, and hence the clemscore
  (the aggregated score across all games) becomes incomparable (or at least much harder to compare
  compared to earlier versions.
- The **minor** number changes:
    - when new *instances* within the same games are created, and hence a comparison of scores across 
      versions has to be interpreted as comparison within the same game, not the same game problems
    - scoring or parsing rules in the games have changed in such a way as to influence the scores
       (in a minor way).
