# Changes between versions

This file documents all changes made between versions of the benchmark which affect the results.

In general, we follow a semantic versioning approach:
- The **major** number changes when new games are added, and hence the clemscore
  (the aggregated score across all games) becomes incomparable (or at least much harder to compare
  compared to earlier versions.
- The **minor** number changes:
    - when new *instances* within the same games are created, and hence a comparison of scores across 
      versions has to be interpreted as comparison within the same game, not the same game problems
    - scoring or parsing rules in the games have changed in such a way as to influence the scores
       (in a minor way).

Note that the dates represent the month in which the version was created. We continuously run new models and add the results to the latest version's directory (so there can be commits with a later date).
