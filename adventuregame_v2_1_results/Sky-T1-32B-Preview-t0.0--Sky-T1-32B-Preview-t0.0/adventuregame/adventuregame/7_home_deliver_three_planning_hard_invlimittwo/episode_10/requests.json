You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYou are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Write your plan for your next actions on the line below your action, starting with \"Next actions:\".\nFor example:\n> open cupboard\nNext actions: take orange, eat orange\n\nYou can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\n\nYour goal for this game is: Put the potted plant on the side table, the book in the refrigerator and the plate on the shelf.\n\nOnce you have achieved your goal, write \"> done\" to end the game.\n\nYou are in a kitchen now. There are a counter, a table and a cupboard. The cupboard is closed. There are passages to a living room, a pantry and a hallway here.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n> open cupboard  \nNext actions: see what's inside, maybe find the potted plant or other items needed for the tasks.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThe cupboard is now open. In the cupboard there is a plate.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n> take plate  \nNext actions: need to put the plate on the shelf later. Now, look around for the potted plant and the book. Maybe check the table or the counter.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYou take the plate. In your inventory you have a plate.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n> close cupboard  \nNext actions: with the plate in hand, I should find the shelf to place it.
