Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX X X X X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX X X X X<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with all rows and columns having the same number of X's and ▢'s. The ▢'s are scattered randomly throughout the grid, with no specific pattern or arrangement.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with five rows and five columns. It contains a mix of X's and ▢'s. The top row and the bottom row are entirely filled with X's. The middle three rows have a combination of X's and ▢'s, with no two ▢'s in the same column.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows or columns in your grid that have only one ▢?
