You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. When you have described everything, you say \"DONE\".\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n\nV V V V V\n▢ ▢ ▢ V ▢\n▢ ▢ V ▢ ▢\n▢ V ▢ ▢ ▢\nV V V V V\n\nWhat is your next command?\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:54:50.856663", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Let's start describing the grid.\n\nThe grid already has some letters filled in.
