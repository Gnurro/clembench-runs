You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I'm starting with a word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<yellow> s<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: table\nexplanation: since \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\" are all present in the word, I'm trying to keep them and replacing the incorrect \"h\" with a common letter \"t\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: cloud\nexplanation: since all the letters in the previous guess were incorrect, I'm trying a new set of letters that are common in many words, and \"c\", \"l\", and \"o\" are all present in the word \"cloud\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<yellow> l<red> o<green> u<green> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: color\nexplanation: since \"o\" and \"u\" are in the correct position, I'm trying to build on that by guessing a word that includes these letters in the same position, and \"c\" is also in the correct position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<yellow> o<yellow> l<red> o<red> r<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: coral\nexplanation: since \"c\", \"o\", and \"r\" are in the correct position, I'm trying to build on that by guessing a word that includes these letters in the same position, and \"l\" is also present in the word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<yellow> o<yellow> r<yellow> a<red> l<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
