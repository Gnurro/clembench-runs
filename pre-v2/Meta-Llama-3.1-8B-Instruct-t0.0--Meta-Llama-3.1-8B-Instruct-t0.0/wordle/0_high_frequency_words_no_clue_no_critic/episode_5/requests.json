This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: steak\nexplanation: since 'e' is green, I'm keeping it in the word, and since all other letters are red, I'm trying a new combination with a different set of consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: teals\nexplanation: since 't' and 'e' are both yellow, I'm keeping them in the word, and trying a new combination with 'a' and 'l' to see if I can get more letters correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> e<yellow> a<red> l<green> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: tales\nexplanation: since 't' and 'l' are both green, and 'e' is yellow, I'm keeping them in the word and trying to find a combination that works with 'a' and's'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> a<red> l<yellow> e<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: tales\nexplanation: since 't' is still green, and 'l' is yellow, I'm keeping them in the word and trying to find a combination that works with 'e' and a new set of letters for 'a' and's'.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-19 15:36:12.633836", "call_duration": "0:00:01.676596", "response": "guess: tales\nexplanation: since 't' is still green, and 'l' is yellow, I'm keeping them in the word and trying to find a combination that works with 'e' and a new set of letters for 'a' and's'.", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:15.817322", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
