This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: steak\nexplanation: since 'e' is green, I'm keeping it in the word, and since all other letters are red, I'm trying a new combination with a different set of consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> e<yellow> a<yellow> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: steak\nexplanation: since 'e' and 'a' are yellow, I'm keeping them in the word, and since they were in the wrong position, I'm trying to swap their positions with the new guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> e<yellow> a<yellow> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: eagle\nexplanation: since 'e' and 'a' are yellow, I'm keeping them in the word and trying a new combination with 'g' and 'l' to see if they fit in the correct positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: e<red> a<green> g<yellow> l<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: gauge\nexplanation: since 'a' is green, I'm keeping it in the correct position, and since 'e' is green and 'g' is yellow, I'm trying to keep them in the word and see if 'u' fits in the remaining position.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-19 15:36:31.792119", "call_duration": "0:00:01.752095", "response": "guess: gauge\nexplanation: since 'a' is green, I'm keeping it in the correct position, and since 'e' is green and 'g' is yellow, I'm trying to keep them in the word and see if 'u' fits in the remaining position.", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:35.250628", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
