This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: shoes\nexplanation: since 'e' is in the correct position, and 'o' and's' are in the correct word but not in the correct position, I'm trying to keep these letters in the new guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> h<red> o<green> e<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: boast\nexplanation: since 'o' and 'e' are in the correct position, and's' is in the correct word, I'm trying to keep these letters in the new guess and use 'b' and 't' as possible consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> o<yellow> a<red> s<yellow> t<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: boast\nexplanation: since 'o' is in the correct position, and's', 't' are in the correct word, I'm trying to keep these letters in the new guess and use 'b' and 'a' as possible consonants, and 'o' is in the correct position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> o<yellow> a<red> s<yellow> t<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: coast\nexplanation: since 'o' is in the correct position, and's' and 't' are in the correct word, I'm trying to keep these letters in the new guess and use 'c' and 'a' as possible consonants.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-19 15:38:37.767633", "call_duration": "0:00:01.695656", "response": "guess: coast\nexplanation: since 'o' is in the correct position, and's' and 't' are in the correct word, I'm trying to keep these letters in the new guess and use 'c' and 'a' as possible consonants.", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:41.433908", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
