This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: horse\nexplanation: since 'h' and's' are in the correct position, and 'o' is in the word but not in the correct position, I'm trying to keep these letters in the same position and replacing the incorrect letters with common ones.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> r<red> s<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: holes\nexplanation: since 'h' and's' are in the correct position, and 'e' is in the word but not in the correct position, I'm trying to keep these letters in the same position and replacing the incorrect letters with common ones, and 'o' and 'l' are also common letters in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> l<red> e<yellow> s<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: holes\nexplanation: since 'h' and's' are in the correct position, and 'e' is in the word but not in the correct position, I'm trying to keep these letters in the same position and replacing the incorrect letters with common ones, and 'o' and 'l' are also common letters in many words, but I'm going to try the original word again to see if it fits.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> l<red> e<yellow> s<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: theme\nexplanation: since 'h' and 'e' are in the word but not in the correct position, and's' is also in the word but not in the correct position, I'm trying to keep these letters in the word and replacing the incorrect letters with common ones, and 't' and'm' are also common letters in many words.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-19 15:37:58.675035", "call_duration": "0:00:02.347473", "response": "guess: theme\nexplanation: since 'h' and 'e' are in the word but not in the correct position, and's' is also in the word but not in the correct position, I'm trying to keep these letters in the word and replacing the incorrect letters with common ones, and 't' and'm' are also common letters in many words.", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:02.527550", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
