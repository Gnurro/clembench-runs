The ▢'s are also scattered, but there are more of them than X's.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns, with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The top-left corner is an X, and the rest of the grid is filled with alternating X's and ▢'s, with no two ▢'s in a row.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the top row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, there are no ▢'s in the top row of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
