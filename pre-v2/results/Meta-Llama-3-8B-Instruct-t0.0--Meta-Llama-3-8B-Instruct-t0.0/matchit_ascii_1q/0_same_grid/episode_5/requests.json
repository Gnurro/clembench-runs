The X symbols are scattered throughout the grid, with no specific pattern.\nQUESTION: Are the ▢ symbols in your grid all in the same row or column? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, the ▢ symbols are not all in the same row or column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that contain only X symbols?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there is one row in my grid that contains only X symbols.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDECISION: different grids<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-21 11:53:15.145448", "call_duration": "0:00:00.201439", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"}}}]
