Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x4 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are scattered throughout the grid, and there are no consecutive X's in any row or column. The ▢'s are also scattered, but there are some areas where they form a pattern.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x4 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are scattered throughout the grid, and there are no consecutive X's in any row or column. The ▢'s are also scattered, but there are some areas where they form a pattern.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows or columns in your grid that are completely filled with either X's or ▢'s? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, there are no rows or columns in my grid that are completely filled with either X's or ▢'s.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that have exactly two X's?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there is one row in my grid that has exactly two X's.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your grid first.
