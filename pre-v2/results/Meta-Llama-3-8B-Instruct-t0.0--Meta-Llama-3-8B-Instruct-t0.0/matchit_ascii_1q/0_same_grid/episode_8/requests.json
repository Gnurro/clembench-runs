Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ X X X ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X ▢ X ▢\n▢ X X X ▢\n▢ X X X ▢<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. It has 3 X's in the first row, and 2 X's in the last three rows. The middle row has only one X. The rest of the grid is filled with ▢ symbols.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. It has 3 X's in the first row, and 2 X's in the last three rows. The middle row has only one X.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
