The X's are arranged in a way that creates a pattern, with some rows and columns having more X's than others. The X's are not randomly distributed, but rather seem to be part of a larger structure.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows or columns in your grid that have only one X? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there is one row that has only one X.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
