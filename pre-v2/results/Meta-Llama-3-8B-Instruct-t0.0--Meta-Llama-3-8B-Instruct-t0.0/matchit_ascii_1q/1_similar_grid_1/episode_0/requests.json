Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. The top row and the bottom row are filled with X's. The middle three rows have a mix of X's and ▢'s, with the ▢'s forming a pattern that is not symmetrical.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x4 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are arranged in a way that creates a series of connected lines, with some X's forming a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right, and others forming a horizontal line in the middle row. The ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid, with no apparent pattern.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the top or bottom row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are ▢'s in the top row of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any X's in the same column as a ▢' in your grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are X's in the same column as a ▢' in my grid.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your grid first.
