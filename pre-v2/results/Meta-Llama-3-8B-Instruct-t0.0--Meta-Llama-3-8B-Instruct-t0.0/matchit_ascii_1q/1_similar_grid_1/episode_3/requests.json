The bottom row is the same as the top two rows.\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid aligned with the edges of the grid (i.e., are they in the first, last, or middle columns)?

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
