Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with 5 rows and 5 columns. It contains 4 X's and 11 empty squares (▢). The X's are not in a straight line, but they are not scattered randomly either. They seem to be forming a pattern, but it's not immediately clear what that pattern is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with a single \"X\" in each row, but not necessarily in the same column. The remaining cells are filled with a symbol that looks like a box or a square (▢).\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid all aligned with the grid's main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right)? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, the X's in my grid are not all aligned with the grid's main diagonal.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
