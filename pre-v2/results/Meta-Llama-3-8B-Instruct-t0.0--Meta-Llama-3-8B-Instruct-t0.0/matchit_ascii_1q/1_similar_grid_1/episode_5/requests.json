Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with all the top-left cells filled with \"X\" and the rest of the cells filled with a square symbol \"▢\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x4 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are arranged in a way that creates a series of connected lines, with some X's forming a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right, and others forming a horizontal line in the middle row. The ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid, with no apparent pattern.\nQUESTION: Are there any X's in the middle row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the top row of your grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
