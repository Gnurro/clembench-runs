The X symbols are arranged in a way that creates a \"wall\" or a \"barrier\" that separates the grid into two main sections. The ▢ symbols are scattered throughout the grid, but there is a concentration of them in the top-left and bottom-right corners.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows or columns in your grid that are completely filled with ▢ symbols? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any X symbols that are directly adjacent to each other in your grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
