The X's are scattered throughout the grid, and the ▢'s are also spread out, but seem to be more concentrated in the middle rows. There are no rows or columns that are entirely filled with the same symbol.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with five rows and five columns. It contains a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are scattered throughout the grid, and the ▢'s are also spread out, but there are five of them in a row in the third row.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the first or last row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there is one ▢ in the first row and one ▢ in the last row of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
