The X symbols are scattered throughout the grid, with no specific pattern.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns, with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are evenly distributed across the grid, with no more than 3 in a row or column. The ▢'s are also evenly distributed, but there are no more than 2 in a row or column. The top-left and bottom-right corners are both X's.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢ symbols that are adjacent to each other (i.e., in the same row, column, or diagonal)? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are ▢ symbols that are adjacent to each other.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
