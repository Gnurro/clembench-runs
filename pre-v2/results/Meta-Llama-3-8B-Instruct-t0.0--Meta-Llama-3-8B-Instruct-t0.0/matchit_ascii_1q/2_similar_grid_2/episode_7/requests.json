The X's are arranged in a way that creates a \"stair-step\" pattern, with the top-left and bottom-right corners being X's, and the rest of the X's forming a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right. The ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid, but there are no two ▢'s that are directly adjacent to each other.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x4 grid of squares, with some of the squares filled with an \"X\" and some left blank.
