Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ X ▢\nX X X ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ X ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are arranged in a way that forms a rough diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, with some gaps in between. The ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid, mostly in the middle and bottom rows.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are scattered throughout the grid, with no two X's directly adjacent to each other. The ▢'s are also scattered, but there are more of them than X's.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the top row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, there are no ▢'s in the top row of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
