Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ X X X X\n▢ X X X X\n▢ X X X X\n▢ X X X X\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with all the top-left squares filled with X's, and the bottom-left squares filled with empty squares (▢).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are scattered throughout the grid, with no two X's directly adjacent to each other. The ▢'s are also scattered, but there are more of them than X's.\nQUESTION: Are there any X's in the bottom-right corner of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, there are no X's in the bottom-right corner of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?
