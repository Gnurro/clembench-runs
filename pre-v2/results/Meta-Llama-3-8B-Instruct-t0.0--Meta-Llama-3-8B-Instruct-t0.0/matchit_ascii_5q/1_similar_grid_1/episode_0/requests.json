The X's are arranged in a way that creates a series of connected lines, with some X's forming a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right, and others forming a horizontal line in the middle row. The ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid, with no apparent pattern.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns.
