The X's are not in a straight line, and there are no two X's in a row.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. It contains 5 X's, 10 ▢'s, and no other characters. The X's are not in a straight line, and the ▢'s are not in a straight line either.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows or columns in your grid that contain only one X? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that contain exactly two X's?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in your grid that are not adjacent to an X? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any X's in your grid that are not adjacent to a ▢?<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-21 12:05:54.875066", "call_duration": "0:00:00.620132", "response": "QUESTION: Are there any X's in your grid that are not adjacent to a ▢?", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"}}}]
