The X's are arranged in a way that forms a rough diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner, with some gaps in between. The ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid, mostly in the middle and bottom rows.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s. The X's are scattered throughout the grid, with no two X's directly adjacent to each other. The ▢'s are also scattered, but there are more of them than X's.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the top row of your grid?
