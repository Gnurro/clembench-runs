The X's are arranged in a way that creates a series of connected lines, with some X's forming a larger shape. The ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid, but are not forming any specific patterns or shapes.\nQUESTION: Are the identical symbols in the last row of your grid the same as the symbol that appears in the other rows and columns?
