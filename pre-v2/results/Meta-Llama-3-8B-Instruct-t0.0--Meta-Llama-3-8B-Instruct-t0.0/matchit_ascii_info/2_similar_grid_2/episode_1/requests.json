Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Each of us can ask 3 questions. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 grid with some blank spaces and some X's. The X's are not in a straight line, and there are no more than two X's in a row.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. It contains 5 X's, 10 ▢'s, and no other characters. The X's are not in a straight line, and the ▢'s are not in a straight line either.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that do not contain an X?
