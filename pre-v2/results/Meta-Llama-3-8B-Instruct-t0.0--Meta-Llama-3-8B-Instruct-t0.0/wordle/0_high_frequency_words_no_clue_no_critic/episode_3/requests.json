This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I'm starting with a word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<green> o<red> u<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: horse\nexplanation: since \"h\" is correct, I'm keeping it. \"o\" is incorrect, so I'm replacing it with a different vowel. \"u\" is correct but in the wrong position, so I'm moving it to a different spot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<green> o<red> r<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: holey\nexplanation: since \"h\" is correct, I'm keeping it.
