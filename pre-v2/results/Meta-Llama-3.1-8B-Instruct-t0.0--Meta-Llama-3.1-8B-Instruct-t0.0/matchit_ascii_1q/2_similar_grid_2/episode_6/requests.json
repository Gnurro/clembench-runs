Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: A 5x4 grid with a mix of X and ▢ symbols, where the X symbols are mostly on the edges and the ▢ symbols are scattered throughout, with some rows having more ▢ symbols than others.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with a mix of X and ▢ symbols, where the X symbols form a border around the grid, and the ▢ symbols are scattered inside, with some patterns and symmetries.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid where all the symbols are X? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the first and last rows in my grid consist entirely of X symbols.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
