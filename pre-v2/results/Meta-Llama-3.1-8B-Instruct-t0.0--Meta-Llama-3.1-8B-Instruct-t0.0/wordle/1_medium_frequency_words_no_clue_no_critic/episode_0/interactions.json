You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:54.762480", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:54.762641", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = scour\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<yellow> u<yellow> s<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:54.762781", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<yellow> s<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:56.424946", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: cloud\nexplanation: since \"o\" and \"u\" and \"s\" are yellow, I'm guessing a word that has these letters, and \"c\" is a common letter that often appears with \"o\" and \"u\" and \"s\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:56.425070", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = scour\nguess = cloud\nguess_feedback = c<yellow> l<red> o<green> u<green> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:56.425219", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<yellow> l<red> o<green> u<green> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:58.398011", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: louds\nexplanation: since \"o\" and \"u\" are green, and \"c\" is yellow, I'm guessing a word that has these letters, and \"d\" is also present in the previous feedback, so I'm trying a word that has \"d\" and the other correct letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:58.398373", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:36:58.398395", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
