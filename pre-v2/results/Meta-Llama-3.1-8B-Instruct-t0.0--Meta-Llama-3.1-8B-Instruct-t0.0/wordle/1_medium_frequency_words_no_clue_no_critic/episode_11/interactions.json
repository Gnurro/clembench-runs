You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:42.562563", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:42.562719", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = noble\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:42.562853", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:44.020838", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: globe\nexplanation: since 'o' and 'e' are correct, and 'o' is in the correct position, I'm trying to build on that with a new word that includes these letters and other common ones."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:44.020981", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = noble\nguess = globe\nguess_feedback = g<red> l<yellow> o<yellow> b<yellow> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:44.021121", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: g<red> l<yellow> o<yellow> b<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:45.960663", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: globe\nexplanation: since 'l', 'o', and 'e' are correct, and 'l', 'o', and 'b' are in the wrong position, I'm trying to keep the correct letters in the same positions and rearrange the others to see if I can get a match."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:45.960816", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = noble\nguess = globe\nguess_feedback = g<red> l<yellow> o<yellow> b<yellow> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:45.960978", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: g<red> l<yellow> o<yellow> b<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:47.725129", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: locale\nexplanation: since 'l', 'o', and 'e' are correct, and 'l', 'o', and 'e' are in the correct positions, I'm trying to build on that with a new word that includes these letters and other common ones."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:47.725207", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guess does not conform to the format rules\nError: The length of the guessed word is not 5."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:38:47.725341", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "game_result = ABORT"}}]], "n_turns": 6, "Played turns": 4, "Complete turns": 3, "Aborted": true, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [1, 1, 1, 1], "Parsed Request Count": [1, 1, 1, 0], "Violated Request Count": [0, 0, 0, 1], "Evaluation": {"target_word": "noble", "target_word_clue": "aristocratic", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "use_clue": false, "use_critic": false, "guess": [["house", "h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<green>"], ["globe", "g<red> l<yellow> o<yellow> b<yellow> e<green>"], ["globe", "g<red> l<yellow> o<yellow> b<yellow> e<green>"]], "guess_explanation": ["this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.", "since 'o' and 'e' are correct, and 'o' is in the correct position, I'm trying to build on that with a new word that includes these letters and other common ones.", "since 'l', 'o', and 'e' are correct, and 'l', 'o', and 'b' are in the wrong position, I'm trying to keep the correct letters in the same positions and rearrange the others to see if I can get a match."], "critic_feedback": {}}}
