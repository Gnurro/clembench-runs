This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with a word that has a mix of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<green> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: brute\nexplanation: since 'u' is green, I'm keeping it in the same position, and I'm guessing a word that has a similar structure with a mix of consonants and a single vowel.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<green> u<green> t<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: brute\nexplanation: since 'b' is red and 'r' and 'u' are green, I'm keeping 'r' and 'u' in the same position, and I'm guessing the same word again to see if the position of 't' is correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<green> u<green> t<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: grunt\nexplanation: since 'r' and 'u' are green, and 't' is yellow, I'm keeping 'r' and 'u' in the same position, and I'm guessing a word that has 't' in a different position, and also includes the consonant 'g'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> r<green> u<green> n<red> t<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: trust\nexplanation: since 'r' and 'u' are green, and 't' is green, I'm keeping 'r', 'u', and 't' in the same position, and I'm guessing a word that has a similar structure with a mix of consonants and a single vowel.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-19 15:38:58.696884", "call_duration": "0:00:01.994326", "response": "guess: trust\nexplanation: since 'r' and 'u' are green, and 't' is green, I'm keeping 'r', 'u', and 't' in the same position, and I'm guessing a word that has a similar structure with a mix of consonants and a single vowel.", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-11-19T15:39:02.604346", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
