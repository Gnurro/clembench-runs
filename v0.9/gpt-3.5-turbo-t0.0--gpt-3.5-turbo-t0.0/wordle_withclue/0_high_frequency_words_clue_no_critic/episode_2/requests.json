This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:amusingly eccentric\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:zany\nexplanation:The clue \"amusingly eccentric\" suggests a word that means something similar to \"quirky\" or \"offbeat.\" The word \"zany\" fits this description and has five letters, so it is a valid guess.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
