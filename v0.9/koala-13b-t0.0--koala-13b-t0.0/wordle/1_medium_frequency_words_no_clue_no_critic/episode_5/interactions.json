You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:23:56.172997", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Please make your first guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:23:56.173001", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation:": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:23:56.173012", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: koala-13b) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "awash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (koala-13b)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:24:00.960234", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:24:00.960277", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:apple\nexplanation: I am starting my guess with the word \"apple\", which is a common five-letter English word.\n\nAssistant: guess:banana\nexplanation: I am continuing my guess with the word \"banana\", which is a common five-letter English word.\n\nAssistant: guess:cherry\nexplanation: I am continuing my guess with the word \"cherry\", which is a common five-letter"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:24:00.960282", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "apple", "explanation:": "I am starting my guess with the word \"apple\", which is a common five-letter English word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:24:00.960317", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = awash\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<green> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "awash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (koala-13b)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "I am starting my guess with the word \"apple\", which is a common five-letter English word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:24:05.892297", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<green> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-14T08:24:05.892331", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:banana\nexplanation:I am guessing the word \"banana\" based on the feedback from my previous guess.
