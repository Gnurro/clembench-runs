You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:26.384650", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": ""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:26.384659", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation:": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:26.384678", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: text-davinci-003) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "juice", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (text-davinci-003)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:27.559248", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:27.559326", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:27.559335", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation:": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:27.559353", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: text-davinci-003) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "juice", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (text-davinci-003)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:31.898311", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:31.898397", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:31.898405", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "apple", "explanation:": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:31.898457", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = juice\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "juice", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (text-davinci-003)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:43.188770", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:18:43.188858", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Based on the feedback, I am guessing that the target word is \"elite\".\nguess:elite\nexplanation:The feedback for my previous guess was a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green>, indicating that the letter 'e' was correct.
