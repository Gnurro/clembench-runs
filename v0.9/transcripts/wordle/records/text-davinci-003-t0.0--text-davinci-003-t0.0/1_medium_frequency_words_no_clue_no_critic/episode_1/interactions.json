You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:21.477522", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": ""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:21.477531", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation:": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:21.477552", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: text-davinci-003) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "check", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (text-davinci-003)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:22.038722", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:22.038800", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:22.038809", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation:": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:22.038828", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: text-davinci-003) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "check", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (text-davinci-003)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:28.086547", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:28.086631", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:28.086641", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "apple", "explanation:": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:28.086689", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = check\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "check", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (text-davinci-003)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:35.436859", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:35.436944", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Based on the feedback, I am guessing that the target word is \"elm\".\nguess:elm\nexplanation:The feedback indicated that the letter 'e' was in the correct position, so I am guessing that the target word is \"elm\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:35.436953", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "elm", "explanation:": "The feedback indicated that the letter 'e' was in the correct position, so I am guessing that the target word is \"elm\"."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:35.436976", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: text-davinci-003) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "check", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (text-davinci-003)", "guess": "elm", "explanation": "The feedback indicated that the letter 'e' was in the correct position, so I am guessing that the target word is \"elm\".", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-06-05T22:20:48.286345", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
