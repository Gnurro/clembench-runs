	 Yes, you are correct! The target word is "election". Since you guessed it within 3 tries, you and I both win! Great job.\\ \tt \\ \tt In the future, if your guess is not the exact target word but is still related to the given clue, you can let me know and I can provide a new clue to help you narrow down the possibilities. That way, we can continue playing the game and trying to find the target word together.
