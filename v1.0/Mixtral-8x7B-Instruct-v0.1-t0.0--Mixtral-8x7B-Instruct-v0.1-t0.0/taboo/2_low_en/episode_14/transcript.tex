	 CLUE: Great job on guessing the word in three tries! You were correct that the target word was "flux" and it refers to a continuous flow or movement. The related words like Delhi belly and Montezuma's revenge were included because they are both terms for a type of illness that involves a lot of flow or movement, specifically diarrhea. I'm glad you had fun with the clues and I'm here to help with any questions you have!
