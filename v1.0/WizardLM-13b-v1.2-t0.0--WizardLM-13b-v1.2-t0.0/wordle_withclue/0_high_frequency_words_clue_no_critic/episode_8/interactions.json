And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:june in hollywood\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-24T02:43:23.554033", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: movie\nexplanation: The clue \"June in Hollywood\" could refer to a movie that takes place in June in Hollywood.
