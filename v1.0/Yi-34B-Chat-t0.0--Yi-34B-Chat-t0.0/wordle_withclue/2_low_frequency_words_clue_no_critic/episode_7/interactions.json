You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:not fulfilled\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T13:42:11.954471", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: desire\nexplanation: The clue \"not fulfilled\" suggests a word related to wanting or needing something that has not been achieved. \"Desire\" is a five-letter word that means \"to want or wish for something.\" The word \"desire\" also contains the letter \"s,\" which is not in the clue but could be a substitution for the \"f\" in \"fulfilled\" since \"s\" and \"f\" are both in the \"s\""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T13:42:11.954475", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "desire", "explanation:": "The clue \"not fulfilled\" suggests a word related to wanting or needing something that has not been achieved. \"Desire\" is a five-letter word that means \"to want or wish for something.\" The word \"desire\" also contains the letter \"s,\" which is not in the clue but could be a substitution for the \"f\" in \"fulfilled\" since \"s\" and \"f\" are both in the \"s\""}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T13:42:11.954487", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: Yi-34B-Chat) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "unmet", "target_word_difficulty": "low_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Yi-34B-Chat)", "guess": "desire", "explanation": "The clue \"not fulfilled\" suggests a word related to wanting or needing something that has not been achieved. \"Desire\" is a five-letter word that means \"to want or wish for something.\" The word \"desire\" also contains the letter \"s,\" which is not in the clue but could be a substitution for the \"f\" in \"fulfilled\" since \"s\" and \"f\" are both in the \"s\"", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH", "target_word_clue": "not fulfilled"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T13:42:18.708579", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
