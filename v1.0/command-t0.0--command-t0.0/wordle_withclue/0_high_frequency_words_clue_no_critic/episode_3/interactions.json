You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:eulogize\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-15T15:18:13.351716", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: ego\nexplanation: The word that fits the clue is the 5 letter word \"eulogize\", but \"ego\" also works because the first three letters of the word are the same, and \"ego\" also has five letters. \n\nThe feedback for \"ego\" might be:\nguess_feedback: e<green> g<yellow> o<green> <red>\n\nThe explanation for that guess could be the following:\nBoth the clue and the feedback have the letters \"ego\" in them."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-15T15:18:13.351728", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "ego", "explanation:": "The word that fits the clue is the 5 letter word \"eulogize\", but \"ego\" also works because the first three letters of the word are the same, and \"ego\" also has five letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-15T15:18:13.351758", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: command) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "extol", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (command)", "guess": "ego", "explanation": "The word that fits the clue is the 5 letter word \"eulogize\", but \"ego\" also works because the first three letters of the word are the same, and \"ego\" also has five letters.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH", "target_word_clue": "eulogize"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-11-15T15:18:16.441073", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
