You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:when repeated, comforting comment\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:21.175974", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "A: bird\nB: branch\nC: home\nD: nest\nE: shelter\n\nPlease provide your first guess and the corresponding explanation."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:21.175978", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation:": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:21.175987", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: deepseek-llm-7b-chat) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "there", "target_word_difficulty": "low_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (deepseek-llm-7b-chat)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT", "target_word_clue": "when repeated, comforting comment"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.503762", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.503792", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "clue:when repeated, comforting comment\n\nguess:sooth\nexplanation: The word has 5 letters and the repeated comforting comment can be \"sooth\" which means to calm or reassure someone.\n\nPlease provide the guess_feedback."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.503796", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "sooth", "explanation:": "The word has 5 letters and the repeated comforting comment can be \"sooth\" which means to calm or reassure someone."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.503822", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = there\ntarget_word_clue = when repeated, comforting comment\nguess: sooth\nguess_feedback: s<red> o<red> o<red> t<yellow> h<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "there", "target_word_difficulty": "low_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (deepseek-llm-7b-chat)", "guess": "sooth", "explanation": "The word has 5 letters and the repeated comforting comment can be \"sooth\" which means to calm or reassure someone.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "when repeated, comforting comment"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.831193", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> o<red> o<red> t<yellow> h<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.831217", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Please provide the next guess based on the given feedback."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.831220", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation:": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:22.831230", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: deepseek-llm-7b-chat) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "there", "target_word_difficulty": "low_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (deepseek-llm-7b-chat)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT", "target_word_clue": "when repeated, comforting comment"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:23.640317", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T15:58:23.640341", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by \"INVALID_FORMAT\".
