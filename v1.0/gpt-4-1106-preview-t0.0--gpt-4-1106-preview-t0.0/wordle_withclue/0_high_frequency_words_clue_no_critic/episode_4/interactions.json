You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:lively dance\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:44.899802", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: salsa\nexplanation: Salsa is a type of lively dance known for its energetic movements, and it is also a five-letter word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:44.899811", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "salsa", "explanation:": "Salsa is a type of lively dance known for its energetic movements, and it is also a five-letter word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:44.899852", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = polka\ntarget_word_clue = lively dance\nguess: salsa\nguess_feedback: s<red> a<red> l<green> s<red> a<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "polka", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4-1106-preview)", "guess": "salsa", "explanation": "Salsa is a type of lively dance known for its energetic movements, and it is also a five-letter word.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "lively dance"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:47.944242", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> a<red> l<green> s<red> a<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:47.944308", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:jiggy\nexplanation: Given the feedback, the letters 's' and 'a' are incorrect, but 'l' and the last 'a' are correct and in the correct positions. \"Jiggy\" is a term associated with lively dance, especially from the phrase \"gettin' jiggy with it,\" and it fits the pattern with 'l' as the third letter and 'a' as the fifth letter."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:47.944313", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "jiggy", "explanation:": "Given the feedback, the letters 's' and 'a' are incorrect, but 'l' and the last 'a' are correct and in the correct positions. \"Jiggy\" is a term associated with lively dance, especially from the phrase \"gettin' jiggy with it,\" and it fits the pattern with 'l' as the third letter and 'a' as the fifth letter."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:47.944344", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = polka\ntarget_word_clue = lively dance\nguess: jiggy\nguess_feedback: j<red> i<red> g<red> g<red> y<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "polka", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4-1106-preview)", "guess": "jiggy", "explanation": "Given the feedback, the letters 's' and 'a' are incorrect, but 'l' and the last 'a' are correct and in the correct positions. \"Jiggy\" is a term associated with lively dance, especially from the phrase \"gettin' jiggy with it,\" and it fits the pattern with 'l' as the third letter and 'a' as the fifth letter.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "lively dance"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:50.714510", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: j<red> i<red> g<red> g<red> y<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-09T14:48:50.714614", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:polka\nexplanation:The previous guesses have shown that 'l' is the third letter and 'a' is the fifth letter. \"Polka\" is another type of lively dance that fits the pattern with 'l' as the third letter and 'a' as the last letter.
