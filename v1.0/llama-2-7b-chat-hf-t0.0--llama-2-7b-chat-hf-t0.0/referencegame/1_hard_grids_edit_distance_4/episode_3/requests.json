You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.\nGrids have empty cells marked with \"▢\" and filled cells marked with \"X\".\nThe goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as \"Target grid\".\nGenerate the referring expression starting with the tag \"Expression: \" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.\n\nHere is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.\n\nTarget grid:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSecond grid:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nThird grid:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nThe referring expression for the given target grid is like so:\nExpression: Filled as T.\n\nOk. Now do this for the following grids.\n\nTarget grid:\n\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n▢ X X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSecond grid:\n\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X X ▢ ▢\nX X ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nThird grid:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nGenerate the referring expression for the given target.
