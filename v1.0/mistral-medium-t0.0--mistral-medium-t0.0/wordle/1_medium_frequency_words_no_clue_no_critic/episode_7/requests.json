You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to get an initial idea of the possible letters in the target word.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> b<yellow> l<red> e<red>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:taste\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the previous guess, I know that 'a' and 'b' are present in the target word but not in their current positions.
