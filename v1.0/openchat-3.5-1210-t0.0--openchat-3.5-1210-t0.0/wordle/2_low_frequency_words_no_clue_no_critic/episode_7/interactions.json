You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:50.884104", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:50.884108", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "apple", "explanation:": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:50.884130", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = unmet\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unmet", "target_word_difficulty": "low_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat-3.5-1210)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:52.538013", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:52.538041", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: orange\nexplanation: I noticed that none of the letters in the first guess were correct, so I chose a new word with no common letters. \"Orange\" is a common five-letter English word and has no letters in common with \"apple.\""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:52.538044", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "orange", "explanation:": "I noticed that none of the letters in the first guess were correct, so I chose a new word with no common letters. \"Orange\" is a common five-letter English word and has no letters in common with \"apple.\""}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:52.538055", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: openchat-3.5-1210) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unmet", "target_word_difficulty": "low_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat-3.5-1210)", "guess": "orange", "explanation": "I noticed that none of the letters in the first guess were correct, so I chose a new word with no common letters. \"Orange\" is a common five-letter English word and has no letters in common with \"apple.\"", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-02-07T11:19:54.318580", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
