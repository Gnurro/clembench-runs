You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.\nGrids have empty cells marked with \"▢\" and filled cells marked with \"X\".\nThe goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as \"Target grid\".\nGenerate the referring expression starting with the tag \"Expression: \" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.\n\nHere is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.\n\nTarget grid:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSecond grid:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nThird grid:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nThe referring expression for the given target grid is like so:\nExpression: Filled as T.\n\nOk. Now do this for the following grids.\n\nTarget grid:\n\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X X X ▢\n▢ X X X ▢\nX X X X X\n\nSecond grid:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X X ▢\n▢ X X X ▢\nX X X X X\n\nThird grid:\n\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ X X X ▢\n▢ X ▢ X ▢\nX X X X X\n\nGenerate the referring expression for the given target."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-24T04:55:15.556395", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "<|assistant|>\nExpression: Bottom-right cluster with all filled cells."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-24T04:55:15.556516", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "Invalid generated expression", "original_content": "<|assistant|>\nExpression: Bottom-right cluster with all filled cells."}}]]}
