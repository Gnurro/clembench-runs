	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

Well done!\\ \tt \\ \tt As a helpful assistant, I'm glad I could assist you in this collaborative word guessing game. It was a challenging task, but I'm happy that we both won by guessing the target word within three tries. Thank you for playing with me!
