[/INST] CLUE: Great job on guessing the word in three tries! You were correct that the target word was \"flux\" and it refers to a continuous flow or movement. The related words like Delhi belly and Montezuma's revenge were included because they are both terms for a type of illness that involves a lot of flow or movement, specifically diarrhea.
