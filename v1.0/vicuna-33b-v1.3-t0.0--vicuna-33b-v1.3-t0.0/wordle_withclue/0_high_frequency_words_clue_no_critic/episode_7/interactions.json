You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:shrink with fear\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-22T00:28:52.792141", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: tiny\nexplanation: The word \"tiny\" has 5 letters and fits the clue \"shrink with fear\" as it can describe something small or diminished, which could be associated with feeling fear or being scared."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-22T00:28:52.792145", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "tiny", "explanation:": "The word \"tiny\" has 5 letters and fits the clue \"shrink with fear\" as it can describe something small or diminished, which could be associated with feeling fear or being scared."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-22T00:28:52.792157", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: vicuna-33b-v1.3) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "quail", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (vicuna-33b-v1.3)", "guess": "tiny", "explanation": "The word \"tiny\" has 5 letters and fits the clue \"shrink with fear\" as it can describe something small or diminished, which could be associated with feeling fear or being scared.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH", "target_word_clue": "shrink with fear"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-11-22T00:28:58.503360", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
