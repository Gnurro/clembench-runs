You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-21T16:16:30.986976", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-21T16:16:30.986980", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "apple", "explanation:": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-21T16:16:30.987020", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = extra\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "extra", "target_word_difficulty": "low_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (WizardLM-70b-v1.0)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-11-21T16:16:40.346708", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-21T16:16:40.346748", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation: Based on the feedback, I know that \"a\" and \"e\" are in the word, but their positions are incorrect.
