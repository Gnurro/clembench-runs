You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T12:47:27.705619", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T12:47:27.705622", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess:": "apple", "explanation:": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T12:47:27.705646", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = penne\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<yellow> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "penne", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T12:47:30.271808", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<yellow> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-11-30T12:47:30.271836", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: bridge\nexplanation: Based on the feedback from the previous guess, I have excluded the letters 'a', 'p', 'l', and 'e' and chosen the word 'bridge' as my next guess.
