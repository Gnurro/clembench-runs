        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:olympic vehicle<br/></p>

        <p>guess: car<br/>explanation: According to the clue, the word has a relationship to the Olympics. The modern Olympic Games began in 1896 when Athens, Greece, hosted the first modern Olympic Games. The word car has 5 letters and is closely related to the word &quot;cars&quot;, which represent one of the transportation vehicles. <br/><br/>Another possible explanation: The word &quot;car&quot; can be confused with &quot;care&quot;, which has a relationship with the clue &quot;olympic vehicle&quot; as the word &quot;care&quot; is often associated with the idea of caring about something, and the Olympic games are cared for by many people.</p>
