This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:one way to be taken\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2023-12-17T16:07:00.695414", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: transport\nexplanation: The clue \"one way to be taken\" could be referring to being taken somewhere by transportation.
