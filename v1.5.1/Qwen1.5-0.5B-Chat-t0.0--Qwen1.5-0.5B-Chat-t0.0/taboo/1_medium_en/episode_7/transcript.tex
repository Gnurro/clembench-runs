	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

It could be a decision made by someone, an event that has taken place, or a situation that is about to become more serious. The implications of this word could be anything from positive to negative, depending on how it is used in context. For example, "The decision was made by the manager," "The event took place," or "The situation is about to become more serious."
