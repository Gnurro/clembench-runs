        <p>Answer: Yes.<br/><br/>Explanation: The resume mentions that the applicant has a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Literature, which implies that they have studied literature as their field of study. Therefore, if the interviewer were to ask about the specific area of study, they would likely be able to identify the subject based on the information provided in the resume. However, without further context or details about the applicant&#x27;s academic background, it is impossible to say for certain whether the interviewer knows the exact area of study.</p>

        <p>Yes. The interviewer would likely know that I studied Literature as my undergraduate degree. This information is typically included on a resume or cover letter for a position in literature, where the candidate&#x27;s education background is relevant to their field of expertise. Therefore, if asked about the specific area of study, the interviewer would be able to confirm that the candidate has a strong background in literature and may have pursued coursework or research related to literary theory, composition, criticism, or other areas within the discipline.

        <p>Answer: Yes.<br/><br/>Explanation: The recruiter knows that the candidate&#x27;s Bachelor degree is in Literature, as mentioned in their resume. Therefore, if they were to ask the interviewer what area the candidate studied, they would likely have knowledge of the subject matter covered in their undergraduate education. However, since the candidate has not provided any specific information about their industry experience or highest educational achievement, it is possible that the interviewer may not have a comprehensive understanding of the literature field.
