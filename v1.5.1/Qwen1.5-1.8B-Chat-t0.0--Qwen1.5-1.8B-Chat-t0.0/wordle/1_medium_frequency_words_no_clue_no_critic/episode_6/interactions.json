This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-12T13:13:41.877622", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: banana"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-12T13:13:41.877625", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "banana", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-12T13:13:41.877634", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "cleft", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat)", "guess": "banana", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-04-12T13:13:44.017507", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
