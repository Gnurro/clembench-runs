You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:input\nexplanation:This word has all different letters, which increases the chances of getting some green or yellow feedback. It's also a common word, which might appear in the dictionary of allowed words for Wordle.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: i<red> n<red> p<red> u<red> t<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:start\nexplanation:Since the previous guess didn't yield any correct letters, we'll try another common five-letter word. \"Start\" includes different letters and is a frequently used word, so it should provide valuable feedback for our next steps.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<red> a<green> r<green> t<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:state\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from \"start,\" we know that 's', 't', and 'a' are correct letters, but they're not all in their correct positions. By keeping these letters and replacing the incorrect ones with different vowels and consonants, we form \"state,\" which is another common English word. This should help narrow down the possible target word.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<red> a<green> t<red> e<green><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:stale\nexplanation:Given the updated feedback, we now know that 'e' is in the correct position, and 't' is still in the wrong position. We've already used 'r' in our previous guess, so let's replace it with 'l'. The word \"stale\" maintains the correct letters in their known positions while introducing a new letter, which will give us more information about the target word.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<red> a<green> l<red> e<green><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:steal\nexplanation:From the latest feedback, we can confirm that 'l' is not in the correct position. Replacing it with 'i' forms the word \"steal,\" which is another common English word.
