This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\n### Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:I chose \"apple\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter English word and it contains a mix of vowels and consonants.\n### Human: guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>\n\n### Assistant: guess:elope\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I can see that the letter \"e\" is in the correct position, so I chose \"elope\" as my next guess.
