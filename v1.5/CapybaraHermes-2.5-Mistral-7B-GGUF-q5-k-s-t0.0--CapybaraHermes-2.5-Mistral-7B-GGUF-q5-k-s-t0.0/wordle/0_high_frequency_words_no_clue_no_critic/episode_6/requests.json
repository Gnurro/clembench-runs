You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:apple\nexplanation:I am starting my guess with \"apple\" because it is a common five-letter English word, which increases the chances of having letters in the correct position or at least not being completely incorrect.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:earth\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, none of the letters in my first guess \"apple\" were correct.
