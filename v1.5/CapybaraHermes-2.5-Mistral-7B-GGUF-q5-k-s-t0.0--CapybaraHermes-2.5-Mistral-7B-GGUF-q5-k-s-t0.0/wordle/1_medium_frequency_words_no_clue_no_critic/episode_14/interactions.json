You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-06T15:16:39.323238", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: I am starting my guess with \"apple\" because it is a common five-letter English word, which increases the chances of having letters in the correct position or at least not being completely incorrect."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-06T15:16:39.323242", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "I am starting my guess with \"apple\" because it is a common five-letter English word, which increases the chances of having letters in the correct position or at least not being completely incorrect."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-06T15:16:39.323272", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = swash\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (CapybaraHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B-GGUF-q5-k-s)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "I am starting my guess with \"apple\" because it is a common five-letter English word, which increases the chances of having letters in the correct position or at least not being completely incorrect.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-06T15:16:40.667275", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-06T15:16:40.667326", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: chart\nexplanation: Based on the feedback, none of the letters in the first guess appeared in the correct position or with the correct letter.
