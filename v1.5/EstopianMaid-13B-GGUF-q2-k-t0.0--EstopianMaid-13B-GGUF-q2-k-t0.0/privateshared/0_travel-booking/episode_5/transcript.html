        <p>Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information about the departure location for a specific trip based on the details provided by the customer. This includes confirming the origin of the journey, which can be an airport, bus station, train station, or any other designated pick-up point. If you have already booked your ticket with the travel agent, they should have access to this information in their system. However, if you haven&#x27;t provided them with the necessary details, they may</p>

        <p>Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information about a customer&#x27;s departure location based on their booking details. This is typically shared during the initial booking process or can be found in the customer&#x27;s profile if they have an account with the agency. If you need help finding your departure location, please let me know and I will assist you further.</p>

        <p>Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information about the departure location for a booked trip. However, if the traveler has not yet finalized their itinerary or made a reservation, the agent may need additional details before providing an accurate answer. It&#x27;s always best to have as much information as possible when consulting with a travel agent to ensure they can provide the most accurate and helpful assistance.</p>

        <p>Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information on the departure location for a specific trip. However, if you haven&#x27;t booked a ticket yet, they might not have that information until you provide them with your intended destination. So, in some cases, the answer could be no. But generally, the travel agent should know where you are leaving from once you provide them with the necessary details. Is there anything else you need me to assist you with?</p>
