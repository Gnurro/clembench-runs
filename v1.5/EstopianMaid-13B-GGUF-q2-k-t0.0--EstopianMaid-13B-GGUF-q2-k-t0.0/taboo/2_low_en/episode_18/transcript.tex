	 CLUE: A type of needlework that involves stitching colored threads onto fabric to create patterns or designs. It is often used for decorating clothes and household items like cushions, curtains, and tablecloths. The second clue is that the stitches are usually very small and intricate, making it a time-consuming but rewarding craft. Finally, embroidery can be done by hand or with the help of an embroidery machine,
