This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-06T15:06:45.562995", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is my first guess, and I am starting with a common five-letter English word that contains two vowels (a and e) and one consonant (p).
