I'm keeping \"u\" and trying to build around it with a new word that has a similar sound and structure to \"house\". Let's see if I can get more correct letters!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<red> o<red> u<yellow> s<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:unite\nexplanation:Again, \"u\" is a correct letter but not in the right position. I'm keeping \"u\" and trying to use it as a anchor to build a new word. I've also noticed that the feedback doesn't contain any green letters yet, so I'm trying to introduce some common letters like \"i\", \"t\", and \"n\" to increase my chances of getting at least one correct letter in the right position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: u<green> n<green> i<yellow> t<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:unita\nexplanation:I'm thrilled to see that I finally got two letters in the right positions - \"u\" and \"n\"! With \"i\" and \"t\" being correct but not in the right positions, I'm trying to build a new word around them. I've added an \"a\" at the end, which is a common letter in many words, hoping it might fit in the remaining blank.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
