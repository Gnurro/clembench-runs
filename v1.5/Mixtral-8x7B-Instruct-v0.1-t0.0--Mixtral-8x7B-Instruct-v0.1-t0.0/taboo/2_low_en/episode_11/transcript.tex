	 That's correct! You've guessed the target word in just one try. That means we both win! The word was indeed "transplant." You've done a great job following the rules and playing in a fair and positive manner. Thank you for the enjoyable game! If you'd like to play again or have any other questions, just let me know. ðŸ˜Š
