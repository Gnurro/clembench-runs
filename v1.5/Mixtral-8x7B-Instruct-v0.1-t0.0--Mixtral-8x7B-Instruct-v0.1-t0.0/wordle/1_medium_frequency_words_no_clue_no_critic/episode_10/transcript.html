        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>For instance, if your guess is &quot;apple&quot;, your response should be<br/>guess: apple<br/> explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.</p>

        <p>Guess: solve<br/>Explanation: I&#x27;m starting with this word because it&#x27;s a short, common English word that contains letters which are often found in many other words. The feedback will help me determine if any of these letters are present in the target word and if so, where they might be positioned.</p>
