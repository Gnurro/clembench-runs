This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:INVALID_FORMAT\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:lattice\nexplanation:I chose this word because it is a five-letter English word and it contains letters that I haven't used in my previous guesses.
