This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-20T14:12:55.344438", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Guess: solve\nExplanation: I'm starting with this word because it's a short, common English word that contains letters which are often found in many other words.
