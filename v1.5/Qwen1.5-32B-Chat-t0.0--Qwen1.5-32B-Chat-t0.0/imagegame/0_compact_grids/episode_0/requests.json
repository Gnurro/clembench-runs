Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next instruction?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving instructions. When you have described everything, you say \"DONE\".\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ B\n▢ ▢ ▢ B ▢\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\n▢ B ▢ ▢ ▢\nB B B B B\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nInstruction: Place a B in the first row, fourth column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nInstruction: Place a B in the second row, second column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nInstruction: Place a B in the third row, first column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nInstruction: Fill the fourth row, starting from the first column, with B's<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-04-26 18:26:53.862411", "call_duration": "0:00:01.049705", "response": "Instruction: Fill the fourth row, starting from the first column, with B's", "model_name": "Qwen1.5-32B-Chat"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-04-26T18:26:57.496858", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nLet us draw something together.
