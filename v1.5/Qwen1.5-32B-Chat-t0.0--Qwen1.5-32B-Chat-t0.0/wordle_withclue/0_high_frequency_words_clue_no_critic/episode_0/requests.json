Let's simplify the word further by removing one letter. \"Arat\" is a three-letter word that includes 'a', 'r', and 't', which are confirmed to be in the target word. While it's not a common word, it's possible that it could be the target, especially if the context is less common or obscure. The clue \"embark\" might not be directly related\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:tarot\nexplanation:Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's go back to the word \"tarot\" as it was a valid five-letter word containing 't', 'a', and 'r' in various positions. The clue \"embark\" might not be directly related, but it could be a stretch to consider a journey through tarot cards. We've tried other options, and \"tarot\" remains a strong candidate given the confirmed letters.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> r<yellow> o<red> t<green><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:tarot\nexplanation:It appears there was a misunderstanding earlier.
