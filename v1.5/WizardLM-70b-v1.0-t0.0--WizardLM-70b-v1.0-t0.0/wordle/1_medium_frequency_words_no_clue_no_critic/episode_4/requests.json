This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nASSISTANT: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n</s> \nUSER: guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>\nASSISTANT: guess:table\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I know that the letter \"e\" is in the word but in the wrong position.
