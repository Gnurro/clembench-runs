        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:square<br/></p>

        <p>guess: block<br/>explanation: The clue &#x27;square&#x27; makes me think of something with four equal sides. A &#x27;block&#x27; fits this as it is a square shape. As a common five letter word, it seems a reasonable first guess to help narrow down the possibilities.</p>

        <p>guess:quart<br/>explanation: My previous guesses of block and cubic did not contain any correct letters, so I need to try a new word that fits with the &#x27;square&#x27; clue. A quart is a unit of capacity that is equal to a quarter of something, usually a gallon. Since a &#x27;quarter&#x27; makes me think of four equal parts like the four sides of a square, &#x27;quart&#x27; seems like a reasonable guess to try next while using all new letters.</p>

        <p>guess: parry<br/>explanation: From the previous guess, the only letter revealed was &#x27;r&#x27; which is present but in the wrong position. Thinking about the &#x27;square&#x27; clue again, this makes me consider words related to shapes. A parry is a fencing/boxing defensive technique where you deflect your opponent&#x27;s attack to the side in a motion similar to a square shape.

Thinking of the &#x27;square&#x27; clue, the word &#x27;carry&#x27; came to mind as it relates to carrying or moving square objects.
