The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\n\nPlease respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\nagreement:yes or no\nexplanation:your reason for doing so\n\nPlease note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\n\nLet's begin!\n\nclue:swelter\nguess:sweat\nexplanation:The clue \"swelter\" refers to feeling very hot. The word \"sweat\" relates to feeling hot and has 5 letters.\n\n\n\n\nclue:swelter\nguess:steal\nexplanation:Based on the previous guess feedback, \"s\" and \"a\" are correct letters but in the wrong position. \"t\" is a correct letter in the correct position.

Using this new information, I guessed \"slate\" because it contains the letters \"s\", \"t\", \"a\", and \"r\" without \"i\", and positions \"a\" correctly.\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> t<yellow> a<green> i<red> r<yellow>\n\n\n\nclue:swelter\nguess:spate\nexplanation:Based on the updated feedback, \"s\" and \"t\" are correct letters in the wrong positions, while \"a\" remains in the correct position. \"l\" and \"e\" are incorrect.

Using this, I updated my guess to \"swamp\" which positions \"s\", \"a\", and \"t\" correctly while avoiding \"p\" and \"e\".

You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red).
