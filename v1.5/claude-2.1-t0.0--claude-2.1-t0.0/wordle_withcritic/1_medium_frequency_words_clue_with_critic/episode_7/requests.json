The guess also properly incorporates the previous feedback that the letters L and E are correct but in the wrong positions. Unless future feedback indicates otherwise, \"least\" seems like an appropriate 5 letter guess for the clue \"just\".\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "guess:least\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "guess_feedback: l<yellow> e<green> a<red> s<red> t<red>"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "clue:just\nguess:jest\nexplanation:Based on the previous feedback, L and E are confirmed correct letters that need to be included.
