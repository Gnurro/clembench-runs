Since the previous guesses were not valid words, I'm trying a new approach and guessing the word \"jolly\", which has 5 letters and could potentially fit the clue, as something that is just or fair could also be considered jolly or cheerful.\nguess_feedback: j<red> u<red> d<red> g<red> e<yellow>\n\n\n\nclue:just\nguess:jelly\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the previous guess, the word contains the letter 'y' in the correct position, but the other letters are incorrect. The clue \"just\" suggests a word related to something that is fair or right. The word \"jelly\" has 5 letters and could potentially fit the clue, as something that is just or fair could also be described as having a jelly-like consistency.\nguess_feedback: j<red> u<red> i<red> c<red> y<green>\n\n\n\nclue:just\nguess:jolly\nexplanation:The clue \"just\" suggests a word related to something that is fair or right.

The clue \"just\" suggests a word related to something that is fair or right.
