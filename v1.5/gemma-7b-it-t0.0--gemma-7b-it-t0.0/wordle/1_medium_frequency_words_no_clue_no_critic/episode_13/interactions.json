You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:46:14.285812", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "## Round 1\n\n**Guess:** orange\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis was a safe guess to start with as it has a high frequency of occurrence in the English language and includes the vowel \"o\".
