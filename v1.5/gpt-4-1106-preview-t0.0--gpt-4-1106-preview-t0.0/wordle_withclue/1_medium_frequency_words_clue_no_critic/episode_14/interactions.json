You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:bravado\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:47:30.152875", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: bluff\nexplanation: The word \"bluff\" is associated with bravado, which often involves displaying confidence or boldness, sometimes without the ability to back it up. \"Bluff\" fits the five-letter requirement for the game."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:47:30.152884", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "bluff", "explanation": "The word \"bluff\" is associated with bravado, which often involves displaying confidence or boldness, sometimes without the ability to back it up. \"Bluff\" fits the five-letter requirement for the game."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:47:30.152923", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = swash\ntarget_word_clue = bravado\nguess: bluff\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<red> u<red> f<red> f<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4-1106-preview)", "guess": "bluff", "explanation": "The word \"bluff\" is associated with bravado, which often involves displaying confidence or boldness, sometimes without the ability to back it up. \"Bluff\" fits the five-letter requirement for the game.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:47:32.400383", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> l<red> u<red> f<red> f<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:47:32.400483", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: boast\nexplanation: Since all letters in \"bluff\" were incorrect, I am trying a new word associated with bravado. \"Boast\" means to talk with excessive pride and self-satisfaction about one's achievements, possessions, or abilities, which aligns with the concept of bravado.
