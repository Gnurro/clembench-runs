	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: “{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}”. Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a nieghboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration replace <action> with "DONE".\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What should we do?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What should we do?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What should we do?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a bathroom", "action": "DONE"}\\ \tt Let us start. \\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: north. What should we do?
