	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: “{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}”. Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a nieghboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration replace <action> with "DONE".\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What should we do?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What should we do?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What should we do?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a bathroom", "action": "DONE"}\\ \tt Let us start. \\ \tt We are now in this room. From here we can go: east. What should we do?

	  Based on the image, it appears to be a formal dining room. From this room, you can go north, west, or south. If you want to continue exploring the house, you could go west to see if there are any other rooms in that direction. If you're done exploring and want to return to the main hallway, you could go south. If you're ready to stop exploring, you could go north, as that would likely lead back to the
