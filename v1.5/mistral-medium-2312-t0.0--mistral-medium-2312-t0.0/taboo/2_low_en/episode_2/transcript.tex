	 Thank you! I'm glad I could help you guess the target word correctly. Yes, "seize" can be used in various contexts, but it often implies a sudden and forceful taking of control. Great job on guessing it in just 3 tries! If you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, just let me know.
