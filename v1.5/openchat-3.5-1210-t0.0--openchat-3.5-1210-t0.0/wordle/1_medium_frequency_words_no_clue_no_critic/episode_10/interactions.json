You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:57:10.425357", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:57:10.425360", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:57:10.425386", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = caper\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<green> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "caper", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat-3.5-1210)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:57:12.627473", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<green> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:57:12.627503", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: orange\nexplanation: I replaced the incorrect letters 'a' and 'e' with 'o' and removed the incorrect 'p' and 'l' from the previous guess.
