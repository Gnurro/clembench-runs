Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next instruction?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving instructions. When you have described everything, you say \"DONE\".\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n\nV V V V V\n▢ ▢ ▢ V ▢\n▢ ▢ V ▢ ▢\n▢ V ▢ ▢ ▢\nV V V V V\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the first row, first column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the last row, last column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the second row, last column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the first row, last column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the last row, second column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the second row, second column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the third row, second column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place a V in the fourth row, second column.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: DONE<|end_of_turn|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-03-08 15:37:54.349894", "call_duration": "0:00:05.199493", "response": "Instruction: DONE", "model_name": "openchat_3.5"}}}]
