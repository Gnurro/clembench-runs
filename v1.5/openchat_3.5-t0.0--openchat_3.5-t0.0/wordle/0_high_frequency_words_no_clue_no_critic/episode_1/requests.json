This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:eleph\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I removed the incorrect letters 'a', 'p', and 'l' and replaced them with the correct letters 'e', 'l', and 'p' to form the new guess 'eleph'.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: your guess is not a valid word for this game.
