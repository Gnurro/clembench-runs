	 Correct, the target word was "combination"! Great job guessing it correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here's a brief explanation of why each of your guesses could be related to the target word:\\ \tt \\ \tt * Synergy: This refers to the interaction or cooperation of two or more agents, substances, or forces to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. In a sense, it's a type of combination that results in a more powerful outcome
