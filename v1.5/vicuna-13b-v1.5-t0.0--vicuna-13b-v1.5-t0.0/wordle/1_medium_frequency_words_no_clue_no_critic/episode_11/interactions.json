You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T02:43:43.647233", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: table\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T02:43:43.647237", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T02:43:43.647261", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = queue\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "queue", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (vicuna-13b-v1.5)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T02:43:47.106053", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-07T02:43:47.106087", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:battle\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the word must contain the letters \"b\", \"l\", and \"e\", and the letter \"t\" is not in the word.
