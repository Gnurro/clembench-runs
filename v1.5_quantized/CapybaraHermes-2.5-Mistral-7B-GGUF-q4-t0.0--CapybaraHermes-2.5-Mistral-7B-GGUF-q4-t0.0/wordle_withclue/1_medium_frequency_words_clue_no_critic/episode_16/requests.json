Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:swelter\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:swarm\nexplanation:The word has five letters, and 's', 'w', 'r', and 'm' are all present in the clue 'swelter'. 'S' and 'r' are in the correct position in 'swarm', but 'w' and 'm' are not. If 's' is correct, then 'w' might be in the wrong place since 'swelter' doesn't contain 'w'.

'Swirl' contains these letters, and 'w' is also present in the clue 'swelter'. However, since 'w' was incorrect in our previous guess 'swarm', it's likely that 'w' is not part of the target word or in the right position.

Since 'swift' contains 's', 'w', and 'r', we can eliminate 'l' from our previous guess. The clue 'swelter' suggests a cold or uncomfortable situation, which could be related to the word 'swift' as it implies quickness or agility, but not directly connected to the clue.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> w<red> i<red> f<red> t<green><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:sweat\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that 'f' and 't' are not in the correct positions, but they are both present in the target word. The clue 'swelter' suggests a hot or uncomfortable situation, which can cause sweating. 'Sweat' contains all five letters of the clue and relates to the given context. Additionally, 's', 'w', and 'a' are in the correct positions in 'swe\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> w<red> e<red> a<yellow> t<green><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:swelter\nexplanation:The feedback shows that 'e' and 't' are not in the correct positions, but they are both present in the target word. Since 'swelter' is the given clue, it is the correct guess.
