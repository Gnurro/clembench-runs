This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:sassy\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:sally\nexplanation:The word \"sassy\" describes someone as being bold or having a lively personality, which can be associated with the name Sally, a short form of Sarah or Sally, which has 5 letters and starts with 's'.

The word \"salad\" has 5 letters and includes both 's' and 'a'. If 'l' was in the target word but not in the right place, it would be yellow, but since it's red, it means 'l' is not in\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> a<yellow> l<red> a<red> d<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:saucy\nexplanation:The word \"saucy\" has 5 letters and includes the letter 's' and 'a', which were correct in our previous guess. The clue \"sassy\" suggests that we need a word with a similar connotation, and \"saucy\" means bold or lively, similar to \"sassy\".
