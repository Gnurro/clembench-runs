I notice that 'h' is yellow, which means it is in the target word but not in the right place. I choose \"chase\" as my fourth guess because it contains 'h', 'a', and 'e', all of which were either partially or completely correct in the previous feedback.

I choose \"chasm\" as my fifth guess because it contains 'h', 'a', and 's', all of which were either partially or completely correct in the previous feedback.
