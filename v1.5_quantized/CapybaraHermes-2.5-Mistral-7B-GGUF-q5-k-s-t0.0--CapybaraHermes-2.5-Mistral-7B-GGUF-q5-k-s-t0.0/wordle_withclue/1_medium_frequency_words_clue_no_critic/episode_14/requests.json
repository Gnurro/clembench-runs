Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:bravado\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:auditor\nexplanation:The clue \"bravado\" suggests that the target word might involve courage or bravely facing something, which could be associated with the term \"audacity\". I chose \"auditor\" as my guess because an auditor can show bravery by investigating and exposing potential issues in a company. Additionally, 'a', 'u', 'd', 'o' and 'r' are all present in \"bravado\", so\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:audac\nexplanation:Based on the clue \"bravado\" and the feedback from my previous guess, I can see that 'a', 'd' and 'o' are correct letters in the target word. Since \"audacity\" is related to bravado, I can deduce that the missing letter should be 'u', which is present in both \"audacity\" and \"bravado\". Therefore, my new guess is \"audac\", hoping\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:daring\nexplanation:Apologies for the confusion in my previous guess. Since \"bravado\" is associated with courage, I can think of \"daring\" as an adjective that describes someone who shows bravery. The letters 'a', 'd' and 'r' are common between \"daring\" and \"bravado\", so I'm hoping this guess will provide more accurate feedback.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:dares\nexplanation:I understand that the target word must be five letters long. The clue \"bravado\" suggests a connection to courage, and \"daring\" is related to bravery. I noticed that 'a', 'd' and 'r' are common between \"daring\" and \"bravado\". By adding an 's' at the end of \"daring\", I form the word \"dares\", which still contains the same letters\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: d<red> a<yellow> r<red> e<red> s<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:ares\nexplanation:Thank you for the feedback. It seems that 'a' and 'r' are present in the target word but in the wrong positions, while 'd' and 'e' are incorrect letters. Since \"bravado\" is related to courage, I can think of \"adventure\" as a five-letter word associated with bravery. The common letters between \"adventure\" and \"bravado\" are 'a', '\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:dare\nexplanation:Apologies for the confusion in my previous guess. I realized that \"daring\" is a four-letter word, which doesn't fit the requirement of having five letters. Instead, I will focus on the common letters between \"bravado\" and a potential target word. The clue \"bravado\" suggests a connection to courage, and \"adventure\" is a five-letter word related to bravery. 'A',\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
