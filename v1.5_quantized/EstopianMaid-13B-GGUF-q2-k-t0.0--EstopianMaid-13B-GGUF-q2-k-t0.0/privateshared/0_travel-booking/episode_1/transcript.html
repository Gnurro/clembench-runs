        <p>Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information on the departure location for a booked trip. However, if the traveler has not yet specified their departure location, the agent may need additional details before providing an accurate answer. It is important to note that the traveler&#x27;s departure location might change depending on various factors such as airline preferences or personal circumstances. Therefore, it is always advisable to confirm with the travel agent regarding the final departure point.</p>
