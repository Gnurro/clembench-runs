	 Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information about the departure location based on the booking details provided by the customer. However, if there is any confusion or missing information, it's best to clarify with the travel agent before proceeding with the booking process. This will ensure that you have all the necessary information and avoid any potential issues during your trip. Remember, always communicate clearly with the travel agent to avoid misunderstandings and enjoy a hassle-free journey!

	 Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information about a customer's departure location based on their booking details. This is typically shared during the initial booking process or can be found in the customer's profile if they have an account with the agency. If you need help finding your departure location, please let me know and I will assist you further.

	 Yes. The travel agent should be able to provide information on the departure location for a booked trip. However, if the traveler has not yet specified their departure location, the agent may need additional details before providing an accurate answer. It is important to note that the traveler's departure location might change depending on various factors such as airline preferences or personal circumstances. Therefore, it is always advisable to confirm with the travel agent regarding the final departure point.
