	 Yes. The interviewer should be able to provide an answer to that question as it relates directly to their own knowledge and understanding of your academic background. If they are not familiar with your area of study, it could indicate a lack of interest in your application or a potential misunderstanding about the role you're applying for. It's important to remember that this is an opportunity for both parties to assess each other's fit within the organization and the position. So, if the inter

However, if they are not familiar with your background or have not reviewed your resume beforehand, they might ask for clarification or refer to their notes to confirm the information. It's important to maintain eye contact and remain professional throughout the interaction.

However, I cannot predict if they will remember it correctly without prompting. If you're concerned about this, you can always provide a brief reminder or clarification when necessary. Remember, maintaining clear communication is key to ensuring understanding between both parties. Good luck with your interview!
