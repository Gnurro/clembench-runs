	 Yes. The interviewer would know the area I studied as it is clearly mentioned in my resume and during our initial conversation. My resume highlights my specialization in Computer Science, specifically focusing on software engineering and data structures. Additionally, we have discussed my previous projects and experiences related to this field during the interview process. So, the answer is a confident yes. The interviewer would be aware of the area I studied. \\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's move forward
