	 No. The questioner does not know what is on my left. This is because I am a chatbot and do not have a physical location, so the concept of "left" does not apply to me. However, if you provide more context or ask a different question, I will be happy to assist you further. Please feel free to continue asking questions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Note: The response provided is based on the assumption that the questioner is interacting with a chatbot through text communication.
