	 No. The questioner does not know what is on my left. This is because I am a chatbot and do not have a physical location, so the concept of "left" does not apply to me. However, if you provide more context or ask a different question, I will be happy to assist you further within the scope of my capabilities. Please feel free to continue asking questions.
