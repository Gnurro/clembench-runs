This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, hoping to get some correct letters in the right positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:fence\nexplanation:Since none of the letters in \"house\" were correct except for the letter \"e\" which is in the wrong position, I'm trying a new word that includes the letter \"e\" and excludes the letters \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\". The word \"fence\" meets these criteria and is a common five-letter English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<green> e<yellow> n<red> c<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:flake\nexplanation:With the letter \"f\" being correct and in the right position, I'm building upon that by trying to find a word that keeps the \"f\" and includes the letter \"e\" which is still in the wrong position. The word \"flake\" meets these criteria and is a common five-letter English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<green> l<red> a<red> k<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:fable\nexplanation:With the letter \"f\" still being correct and in the right position, and the letter \"e\" still being present but in the wrong position, I'm trying to find a word that keeps these letters and replaces the incorrect ones. The word \"fable\" meets these criteria and is a common five-letter English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<green> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:fence\nexplanation:I'm revisiting the word \"fence\" since it was one of my earlier guesses, and I've noticed that the letter \"e\" is still present but in the wrong position. The feedback suggests that the letters \"a\", \"b\", and \"l\" are not correct, so I'll try again with a word that keeps the correct \"f\" and tries to find a better fit for the other positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<green> e<yellow> n<red> c<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:faree\nexplanation:Since I've seen this feedback before, I know that the letter \"f\" is correct and in the right position, and the letter \"e\" is present but in the wrong position. I'll try to find a word that keeps these letters and replaces the incorrect ones. The word \"faree\" meets these criteria, although it's not a very common word. Let's see if I get lucky!<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
