You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:rule<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:ruler\nexplanation:The clue \"rule\" makes me think of a ruler, which is a common tool used to measure and enforce rules.

The yellow \"e\" indicates that it's also present in the target word, but not in the correct position. I'm trying to build on this by keeping the \"r\" and \"e\" while replacing the incorrect letters with new ones that fit the clue \"rule\". The word \"reler<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.

The clue \"rule\" makes me think of words related to regulations or guidelines, and \"reels\" is a valid English word that fits the 5-letter constraint.

The yellow \"e\" from the previous feedback suggests that there might be another \"e\" in the target word. I'm replacing the incorrect letters with new ones, and \"reeds\" is a valid English word that keeps the correct letters and tries to utilize the remaining slots effectively.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: r<green> e<green> e<red> d<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:reefs\nexplanation:With the green \"r\" and double \"e\" still in place, I'm trying to create a new word that fits the clue \"rule\".
