You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red).

The clue \"just\" makes me think of playful or humorous connotations, and \"jests\" fits that theme.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:just\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:i disagree with the guess \"jests\" because none of the letters in the feedback are correct, and the explanation doesn't provide a strong connection between the clue \"just\" and the word \"jests\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:rusty\nexplanation:I'm taking a different approach this time.
