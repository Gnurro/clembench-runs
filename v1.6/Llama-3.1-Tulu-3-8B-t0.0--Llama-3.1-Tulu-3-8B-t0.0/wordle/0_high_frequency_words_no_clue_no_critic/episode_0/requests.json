'N' is also correct, so I'm including another common consonant 'f' or 'k'. 'Knife' includes 'n' and 'a', and 'k' is a new letter to test.<|end_of_text|>\n<|user|>\nguess_feedback: k<red> n<red> i<red> f<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details\n<|assistant|>\nguess: apple\nexplanation: 'A' is already confirmed correct, and 'p' and 'l' were previously yellow, suggesting 'apple' might be a good candidate.
