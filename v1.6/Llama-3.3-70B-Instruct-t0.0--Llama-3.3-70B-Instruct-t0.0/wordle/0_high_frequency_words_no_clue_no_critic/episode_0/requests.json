This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: coach\nexplanation: since \"o\" was marked as yellow, it is likely to be in the word but not in the correct position, so I'm keeping it in my next guess, and combining it with other common letters to form a new word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> o<yellow> a<yellow> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: boats\nexplanation: both \"o\" and \"a\" were marked as yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct position, so I'm keeping them in my next guess and trying to utilize them in a new combination with other common letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> o<yellow> a<yellow> t<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: loads\nexplanation: since both \"o\" and \"a\" are still marked as yellow, I'm trying to find a word that incorporates them in a different arrangement, and \"loads\" is a common word that fits this criteria, potentially placing \"o\" and \"a\" in their correct positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<red> o<yellow> a<yellow> d<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: foams\nexplanation: with \"o\" and \"a\" still marked as yellow, I'm introducing the letter \"f\" which is a common starting letter in many words, and combining it with \"o\", \"a\", and other letters to form a new word, hoping to find the correct placement for \"o\" and \"a\".<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:13:41.176028", "call_duration": "0:00:08.614205", "response": "guess: foams\nexplanation: with \"o\" and \"a\" still marked as yellow, I'm introducing the letter \"f\" which is a common starting letter in many words, and combining it with \"o\", \"a\", and other letters to form a new word, hoping to find the correct placement for \"o\" and \"a\".", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:13:58.354957", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
