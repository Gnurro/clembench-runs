This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: glove\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letters \"o\" and \"e\" from the previous guess because they were marked as yellow, indicating they are present in the target word but not in the correct position, and pairing them with new letters to form a valid English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<red> o<yellow> v<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: loves\nexplanation: I'm building on the previous guess by retaining the letters \"o\", \"v\", and \"e\" which were marked as yellow, and adding the letters \"l\" and \"s\" to form a new word, as the presence of \"l\" was previously marked as red but could still fit in a different position, and \"s\" was also previously marked as red but is a common letter in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<red> o<yellow> v<yellow> e<green> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: mover\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letters \"o\", \"v\", and \"e\" from the previous guess, with \"e\" now in the correct position as indicated by the green mark, and replacing the other letters to form a new word, as the combination of \"o\", \"v\", and \"e\" with the addition of \"m\" and \"r\" creates a valid English word that could potentially match the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<red> o<yellow> v<yellow> e<green> r<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: glove\nexplanation: I'm revisiting a previous combination that included \"o\", \"v\", and \"e\", and trying to utilize the knowledge that \"e\" is in the correct position, and \"o\" and \"v\" are in the word but not in the correct position, to form a word that could fit the given feedback, and \"glove\" is a valid English word that meets these criteria.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:15:23.746479", "call_duration": "0:00:10.369873", "response": "guess: glove\nexplanation: I'm revisiting a previous combination that included \"o\", \"v\", and \"e\", and trying to utilize the knowledge that \"e\" is in the correct position, and \"o\" and \"v\" are in the word but not in the correct position, to form a word that could fit the given feedback, and \"glove\" is a valid English word that meets these criteria.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:15:45.257163", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
