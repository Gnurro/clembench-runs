This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: glove\nexplanation: the feedback indicates that the word ends with \"e\" which is a common pattern in many English words, and I'm trying to utilize this information by guessing a word that also ends with \"e\" and contains other relatively common letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<yellow> l<red> o<red> v<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: grape\nexplanation: the feedback shows that \"g\" is in the word but not in the correct position, and \"e\" is in the correct position at the end, so I'm guessing a word that includes \"g\" in a different position and keeps \"e\" at the end, while introducing other common letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<yellow> r<yellow> a<yellow> p<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: grade\nexplanation: the feedback indicates that \"g\", \"r\", and \"a\" are all in the word, but not in the correct positions, and \"e\" is still at the end, so I'm guessing a word that incorporates these letters in a different arrangement, trying to find the correct order.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<yellow> r<yellow> a<yellow> d<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: gauge\nexplanation: the feedback still shows \"g\", \"r\", and \"a\" as being in the word but not in the correct positions, and \"e\" remains at the end, so I'm guessing another word that includes these letters, trying to find a combination that fits, and introducing a new letter \"u\" which is sometimes paired with \"g\" in English words.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:19:45.086314", "call_duration": "0:00:09.644197", "response": "guess: gauge\nexplanation: the feedback still shows \"g\", \"r\", and \"a\" as being in the word but not in the correct positions, and \"e\" remains at the end, so I'm guessing another word that includes these letters, trying to find a combination that fits, and introducing a new letter \"u\" which is sometimes paired with \"g\" in English words.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:20:05.236082", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
