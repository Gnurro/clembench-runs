This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: couch\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letter \"o\" as it was marked green, indicating it's in the correct position, and I'm also including \"u\" since it was marked yellow, meaning it's in the word but not in the correct position, and trying to utilize common word patterns with these letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> o<green> u<yellow> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: pouch\nexplanation: I'm retaining the letter \"o\" in the same position since it was previously marked green, and I'm keeping \"u\" in the word as it was marked yellow, trying to find the correct position for \"u\" while maintaining \"o\" in its correct position, and using common word patterns to form a new guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> o<green> u<yellow> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: moult\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letter \"o\" in the same position as it was marked green, and I'm trying to utilize the letter \"u\" in a different position since it was marked yellow, and introducing new letters \"m\", \"l\", and \"t\" to form a valid English word, hoping to find a correct combination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<yellow> o<green> u<yellow> l<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: mouth\nexplanation: I'm retaining the letter \"o\" in the same position since it was marked green, and I'm keeping the letters \"m\" and \"u\" in the word as they were marked yellow, trying to find the correct positions for \"m\" and \"u\" while maintaining \"o\" in its correct position, and using common word patterns to form a new guess.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:20:35.176991", "call_duration": "0:00:09.784472", "response": "guess: mouth\nexplanation: I'm retaining the letter \"o\" in the same position since it was marked green, and I'm keeping the letters \"m\" and \"u\" in the word as they were marked yellow, trying to find the correct positions for \"m\" and \"u\" while maintaining \"o\" in its correct position, and using common word patterns to form a new guess.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:20:54.584930", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
