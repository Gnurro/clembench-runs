This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: theme\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letters \"h\" and \"e\" from the previous guess because they were marked as yellow, indicating they are present in the target word but not in the correct position, and trying to utilize them in a new combination with other common letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> h<green> e<yellow> m<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: theme\nexplanation: the letters \"t\" and \"h\" are now in the correct position as indicated by the green color, and one of the \"e\"s is also correct, so I'm trying to adjust the other letters to find a fitting word, considering \"theme\" itself is a valid word and might be the target given the strong match.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> h<green> e<yellow> m<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: thine\nexplanation: since \"t\" and \"h\" are in the correct positions and one \"e\" is also correct, I'm replacing the incorrect letters with new ones, considering \"thine\" as it keeps the correct letters and adds common letters that could fit, also noting the double \"e\" might satisfy the yellow \"e\" indication.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> h<green> i<red> n<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: those\nexplanation: keeping the correct \"t\" and \"h\" in place, and trying to utilize the yellow \"e\" in a different position, I'm introducing the letters \"o\", \"s\" which are common in many words, hoping to find a match, considering the word \"those\" as a possible candidate.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:21:23.693253", "call_duration": "0:00:08.302299", "response": "guess: those\nexplanation: keeping the correct \"t\" and \"h\" in place, and trying to utilize the yellow \"e\" in a different position, I'm introducing the letters \"o\", \"s\" which are common in many words, hoping to find a match, considering the word \"those\" as a possible candidate.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:21:40.235043", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
