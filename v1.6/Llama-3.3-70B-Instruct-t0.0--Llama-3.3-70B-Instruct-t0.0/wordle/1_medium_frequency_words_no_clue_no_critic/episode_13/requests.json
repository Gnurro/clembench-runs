This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<green> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: punch\nexplanation: since \"u\" is marked as green, I will keep it in the new guess, and try to utilize common letters and word patterns in English, such as the \"ch\" combination, to increase the chances of getting more correct letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> u<yellow> n<red> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: blunt\nexplanation: with \"u\" now marked as yellow, I will try to find a new position for it, and since it was previously green, I will keep it in the guess, combining it with other common letters like \"b\", \"l\", \"n\", and \"t\" to form a valid English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<red> u<green> n<red> t<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: lusty\nexplanation: since \"u\" is marked as green and \"t\" is also green, I will keep them in the same positions and try to utilize common letters and word patterns in English, such as the \"ly\" or \"ty\" endings, to increase the chances of getting more correct letters, and \"lusty\" seems like a plausible word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<red> u<yellow> s<red> t<yellow> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: utter\nexplanation: with \"u\" and \"t\" now marked as yellow, I will try to find new positions for them, and considering the previous green marks, I will place \"u\" in a position where it was previously green, and \"t\" at the end, to form a valid English word like \"utter\", which seems like a plausible solution.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:32:44.676430", "call_duration": "0:00:09.201220", "response": "guess: utter\nexplanation: with \"u\" and \"t\" now marked as yellow, I will try to find new positions for them, and considering the previous green marks, I will place \"u\" in a position where it was previously green, and \"t\" at the end, to form a valid English word like \"utter\", which seems like a plausible solution.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:33:05.768408", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
