This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: glove\nexplanation: the feedback indicates that the word ends with \"e\" which is a common pattern in many English words, and I'm trying to utilize this information by guessing a word that also ends with \"e\" and contains other relatively common letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<yellow> o<red> v<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: blaze\nexplanation: the feedback shows that \"l\" is present in the word but not in the correct position, and \"e\" is at the end, so I'm guessing a word that includes \"l\" in a different position and maintains \"e\" at the end, while introducing other common letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<yellow> a<yellow> z<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: flake\nexplanation: the feedback indicates that \"l\" and \"a\" are in the word but not in the correct positions, and \"e\" is at the end, so I'm guessing a word that includes \"l\" and \"a\" in different positions and keeps \"e\" at the end, trying to utilize the given letters to form a valid English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> l<yellow> a<yellow> k<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: label\nexplanation: the feedback shows that \"l\" and \"a\" are present in the word, and \"e\" is at the end, so I'm guessing a word that includes these letters in a more likely combination, considering \"label\" is a common English word that fits the given pattern.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:33:33.727135", "call_duration": "0:00:07.735514", "response": "guess: label\nexplanation: the feedback shows that \"l\" and \"a\" are present in the word, and \"e\" is at the end, so I'm guessing a word that includes these letters in a more likely combination, considering \"label\" is a common English word that fits the given pattern.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:33:50.369577", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
