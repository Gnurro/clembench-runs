This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: fence\nexplanation: since the letter \"e\" was marked as yellow, indicating it is in the word but not in the correct position, I've included it in my new guess, and paired it with other common letters to form a valid English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> e<yellow> n<red> c<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: peach\nexplanation: the previous feedback showed that \"e\" was correct but not in the right position, so I've tried to utilize this information by placing \"e\" in a different position, and paired it with other letters that are commonly found together in English words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> e<yellow> a<red> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: bleak\nexplanation: the letter \"e\" is still marked as yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, so I've kept it in my guess and combined it with other letters that are commonly used in English words, trying to find a valid combination that includes the correct placement of \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<red> e<yellow> a<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: theme\nexplanation: since \"e\" is still marked as yellow, I've tried to place it in a different position, and paired it with letters that are commonly found in many English words, such as \"t\", \"h\", and \"m\", to form a valid word that might match the target.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:35:04.926311", "call_duration": "0:00:07.836413", "response": "guess: theme\nexplanation: since \"e\" is still marked as yellow, I've tried to place it in a different position, and paired it with letters that are commonly found in many English words, such as \"t\", \"h\", and \"m\", to form a valid word that might match the target.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:35:21.102279", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
