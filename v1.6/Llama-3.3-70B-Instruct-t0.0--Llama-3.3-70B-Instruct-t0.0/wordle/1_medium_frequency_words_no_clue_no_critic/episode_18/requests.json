You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: hedge\nexplanation: I'm keeping the \"h\" from the previous guess since it was marked yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, and I'm also keeping the \"e\" since it was marked green, indicating it's in the correct position, and adding new letters to form a valid English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> e<red> d<red> g<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: theme\nexplanation: I'm keeping the \"e\" at the end of the word since it was consistently marked green, and the \"h\" is still present but in a different position as it was marked yellow, and adding new letters \"t\" and \"m\" to form a valid English word, while avoiding the previously marked red letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> h<green> e<red> m<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: thine\nexplanation: I'm keeping the \"h\" in the same position since it was marked green, indicating it's in the correct position, and the \"e\" at the end is also kept as it was marked green, and adding new letters to form a valid English word, while avoiding the previously marked red letters and adjusting the position of other letters accordingly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> h<green> i<green> n<green> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: thing\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letters \"h\", \"i\", \"n\", and \"e\" in the same positions since they were all marked green, indicating they are in the correct positions, and replacing the letter \"t\" with a new letter to form a valid English word that matches the given feedback.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:36:35.266591", "call_duration": "0:00:08.090345", "response": "guess: thing\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letters \"h\", \"i\", \"n\", and \"e\" in the same positions since they were all marked green, indicating they are in the correct positions, and replacing the letter \"t\" with a new letter to form a valid English word that matches the given feedback.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:36:51.849365", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
