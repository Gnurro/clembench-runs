This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: punch\nexplanation: since \"u\" was marked as yellow, indicating it is in the word but not in the correct position, I'm trying to utilize this information by placing \"u\" in a different position, and \"p\", \"n\", \"c\", and \"h\" are relatively common letters in many words, making \"punch\" a plausible guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> u<green> n<red> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: blunt\nexplanation: with \"u\" now marked as green, indicating it is in the correct position, I'm keeping \"u\" as the second letter and trying to build around it, using common letters like \"b\", \"l\", \"n\", and \"t\" to form a new word, and avoiding letters that were previously marked as red.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<green> l<yellow> u<yellow> n<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: blunt\nexplanation: since \"b\" is marked as green, indicating it is in the correct position, and \"l\" and \"u\" are marked as yellow, I'm trying to utilize this information by adjusting their positions, but I realized I should try a different approach with \"l\" and \"u\" while keeping \"b\" in the same position, so I'm guessing a word that starts with \"b\" and includes \"l\" and \"u\" in different positions<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<green> l<yellow> u<yellow> n<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: bulks\nexplanation: with \"b\" as green and \"l\" and \"u\" as yellow, I'm trying to find a combination where these letters fit, and since \"u\" was previously green when it was in the second position, I'm placing it back in the second position and adjusting \"l\" to a different position, while avoiding letters that were previously marked as red.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:37:25.644250", "call_duration": "0:00:09.811337", "response": "guess: bulks\nexplanation: with \"b\" as green and \"l\" and \"u\" as yellow, I'm trying to find a combination where these letters fit, and since \"u\" was previously green when it was in the second position, I'm placing it back in the second position and adjusting \"l\" to a different position, while avoiding letters that were previously marked as red.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:37:46.375342", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
