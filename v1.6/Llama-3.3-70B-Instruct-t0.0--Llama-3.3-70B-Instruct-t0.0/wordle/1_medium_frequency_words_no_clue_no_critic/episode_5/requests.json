You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: coach\nexplanation: since \"o\" was marked as yellow, it is likely to be in the word but not in the correct position, so I'm keeping it in my next guess, and combining it with other common letters to form a new word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<green> o<yellow> a<red> c<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: cloth\nexplanation: with \"c\" marked as green, it's likely to be the first letter of the target word, and \"o\" is still marked as yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, so I'm trying to utilize this information to form a new word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<green> l<green> o<green> t<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: cloak\nexplanation: since \"c\", \"l\", and \"o\" are all marked as green, they are likely to be in the correct positions, so I'm building on this by replacing the incorrect letters with new ones to form a word that fits the given pattern.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<green> l<green> o<green> a<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: cloth\nexplanation: given that \"c\", \"l\", and \"o\" are still marked as green, and my previous guess of \"cloth\" had these letters in the correct positions, I'm revisiting this word as it seems to be a strong candidate, despite the earlier rejection of the last two letters.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:26:03.110978", "call_duration": "0:00:07.951472", "response": "guess: cloth\nexplanation: given that \"c\", \"l\", and \"o\" are still marked as green, and my previous guess of \"cloth\" had these letters in the correct positions, I'm revisiting this word as it seems to be a strong candidate, despite the earlier rejection of the last two letters.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:26:19.280370", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
