This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: shelf\nexplanation: I'm keeping the letters \"h\", \"s\", and \"e\" from the previous guess because they were marked as yellow, indicating they are present in the target word but not in the correct position, and trying to utilize them in a new combination with \"l\" and \"f\" to see if I can get a better match.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> h<green> e<green> l<red> f<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: sheep\nexplanation: with \"s\", \"h\", and \"e\" now marked as green, indicating they are in the correct position, I'm trying to build on this success by keeping these letters in the same positions and introducing \"e\" again, along with \"p\", to see if I can complete the word, considering the double \"e\" is a common pattern in English words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> h<green> e<green> e<red> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: sheaf\nexplanation: since \"s\", \"h\", and \"e\" are in the correct positions and the previous guess indicated that a double \"e\" might not be correct, I'm introducing the letter \"a\" and keeping the last letter as \"f\", considering \"sheaf\" is a valid English word that fits the given letters and their positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> h<green> e<green> a<red> f<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: shell\nexplanation: with \"s\", \"h\", and \"e\" still in the correct positions, and considering the previous feedback, I'm trying \"shell\" because it's a common word that fits the given letters and their positions, and it was a close guess earlier when \"shelf\" was tried, indicating that the letters \"s\", \"h\", \"e\", and \"l\" might be part of the target word.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:26:51.135387", "call_duration": "0:00:10.698810", "response": "guess: shell\nexplanation: with \"s\", \"h\", and \"e\" still in the correct positions, and considering the previous feedback, I'm trying \"shell\" because it's a common word that fits the given letters and their positions, and it was a close guess earlier when \"shelf\" was tried, indicating that the letters \"s\", \"h\", \"e\", and \"l\" might be part of the target word.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:27:12.746656", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
