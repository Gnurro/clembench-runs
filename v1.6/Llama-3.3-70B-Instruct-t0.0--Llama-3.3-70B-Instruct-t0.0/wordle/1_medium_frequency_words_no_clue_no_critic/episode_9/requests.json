This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it contains a mix of vowels and consonants that are frequently used in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: space\nexplanation: the feedback indicates that \"s\" is correct but in the wrong position, and \"e\" is correct and in the right position, so I'm keeping these letters and trying to find a word that fits, and \"space\" is a common word that meets these criteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> p<green> a<red> c<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: spice\nexplanation: the feedback shows that \"s\", \"p\", and \"e\" are correct and in the right positions, so I'm building on this by trying to find a word that keeps these letters in the same positions, and \"spice\" is a common word that fits this pattern.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> p<green> i<green> c<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: spice\nexplanation: the feedback indicates that \"s\", \"p\", \"i\", and \"e\" are correct and in the right positions, so I'm trying the same word \"spice\" again, as it already matches the given correct letters, hoping that it's the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> p<green> i<green> c<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess: spite\nexplanation: since \"s\", \"p\", \"i\", and \"e\" are correct and in the right positions, and only the fourth letter is incorrect, I'm replacing \"c\" with \"t\" to get the word \"spite\", which is a valid English word that fits the given pattern.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-12-17 22:29:40.591308", "call_duration": "0:00:08.064659", "response": "guess: spite\nexplanation: since \"s\", \"p\", \"i\", and \"e\" are correct and in the right positions, and only the fourth letter is incorrect, I'm replacing \"c\" with \"t\" to get the word \"spite\", which is a valid English word that fits the given pattern.", "model_name": "Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:30:00.520381", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
