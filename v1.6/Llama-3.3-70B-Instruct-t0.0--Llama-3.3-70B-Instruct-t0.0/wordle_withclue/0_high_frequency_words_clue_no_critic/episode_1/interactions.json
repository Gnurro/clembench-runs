You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: put aside\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:25.886931", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: shelf\nexplanation: The clue \"put aside\" makes me think of storing something, and a shelf is a common place to put things aside, the word shelf has 5 letters and seems like a plausible starting point."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:25.887208", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = table\ntarget_word_clue = put aside\nguess = shelf\nguess_feedback = s<red> h<red> e<yellow> l<green> f<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:25.887419", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> h<red> e<yellow> l<green> f<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:35.355019", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: shell\nexplanation: With the feedback, I see that \"e\" is yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the right position, and \"l\" is green, meaning it's in the correct position, the clue \"put aside\" and the word shell makes sense as in to put something on a shelf, I'm trying to utilize the correct letters to form a new guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:35.355268", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = table\ntarget_word_clue = put aside\nguess = shell\nguess_feedback = s<red> h<red> e<yellow> l<green> l<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:35.355450", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> h<red> e<yellow> l<green> l<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:43.469333", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: yell\nexplanation: The feedback shows \"e\" is still yellow and \"l\" is green, I'm keeping these letters and trying to form a new word, the clue \"put aside\" could be related to yelling to set something aside or to stop, and the word yell seems like a plausible guess with the given letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:43.469425", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guess does not conform to the format rules\nError: The length of the guessed word is not 5."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-12-17T22:39:43.469624", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "game_result = ABORT"}}]], "n_turns": 6, "Played turns": 3, "Complete turns": 2, "Aborted": true, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [1, 1, 1], "Parsed Request Count": [1, 1, 0], "Violated Request Count": [0, 0, 1], "Evaluation": {"target_word": "table", "target_word_clue": "put aside", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "use_clue": true, "use_critic": false, "guess": [["shelf", "s<red> h<red> e<yellow> l<green> f<red>"], ["shell", "s<red> h<red> e<yellow> l<green> l<red>"]], "guess_explanation": ["The clue \"put aside\" makes me think of storing something, and a shelf is a common place to put things aside, the word shelf has 5 letters and seems like a plausible starting point.", "With the feedback, I see that \"e\" is yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the right position, and \"l\" is green, meaning it's in the correct position, the clue \"put aside\" and the word shell makes sense as in to put something on a shelf, I'm trying to utilize the correct letters to form a new guess."], "critic_feedback": {}}}
