You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:mosaic artist's material<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tiles\nexplanation:A mosaic artist's material is often composed of small, arranged tiles. The word \"tiles\" has 5 letters and seems like a plausible fit for the given clue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> i<red> l<red> e<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:teals\nexplanation:Although the feedback indicates that only the letter \"t\" is correct but in the wrong position, I'm going to take a chance and build upon it. The clue mentions a mosaic artist's material, and teals are a type of glass tile often used in mosaics. Additionally, the word \"teals\" has 5 letters, which fits the given constraint.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> e<red> a<red> l<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:teres\nexplanation:With the feedback indicating that only the letter \"t\" is correct but in the wrong position, I'm going to try to utilize it again. The clue mentions a mosaic artist's material, and terra (meaning earth or land) is sometimes associated with mosaics. Although \"teres\" isn't a direct connection, it has 5 letters and seems like a plausible fit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> e<red> r<yellow> e<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:terac\nexplanation:With the feedback indicating that the letters \"t\" and \"r\" are correct but in the wrong position, I'm going to try to build upon them. The clue mentions a mosaic artist's material, and terra cotta is a type of earthenware often used in mosaics. Although \"terac\" isn't a direct connection, it has 5 letters and seems like a plausible fit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
