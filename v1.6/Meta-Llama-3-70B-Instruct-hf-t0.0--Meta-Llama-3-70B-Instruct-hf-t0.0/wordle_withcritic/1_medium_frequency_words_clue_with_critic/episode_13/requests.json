It also fits the 5-letter length.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:repeater, maybe\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:i disagree because although the guess \"reels\" incorporates the correct letters \"r\" and \"e\" from the feedback, the explanation doesn't strongly connect the word \"reels\" to the clue \"repeater, maybe\". the connection to repeating or reeling something in seems a bit stretched, and the word \"reels\" doesn't directly relate to repeating or relaying information.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:rerun\nexplanation:I understand the disagreement, and I'll try to make a stronger connection to the clue.
