You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:14.977655", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "I'm excited to play Wordle!\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.\n\nPlease provide the feedback!"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:14.977658", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:14.977687", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = axial\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "axial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF-q4)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:16.477454", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:16.477551", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "It looks like none of the letters in my initial guess \"house\" appear in the target word.\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'll try a new set of letters that are commonly found in many words. \"Table\" is another common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:16.477556", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'll try a new set of letters that are commonly found in many words. \"Table\" is another common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:16.477591", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = axial\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "axial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF-q4)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'll try a new set of letters that are commonly found in many words. \"Table\" is another common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:18.056790", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:18.056846", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Although \"table\" didn't work out, I noticed that the letters \"a\" and \"l\" appeared in the feedback as yellow, which means they are present in the target word but not in the correct position.
