You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:24.044628", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "I'm excited to play Wordle!\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.\n\nPlease provide the feedback!"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:24.044632", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:24.044662", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = dimly\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "dimly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF-q4)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:25.546108", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:25.546181", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "It looks like none of the letters in my initial guess \"house\" appear in the target word.\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'll try a new set of letters that are commonly found in many words. \"Table\" is another common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:25.546185", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'll try a new set of letters that are commonly found in many words. \"Table\" is another common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:25.546221", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = dimly\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<green> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "dimly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF-q4)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'll try a new set of letters that are commonly found in many words. \"Table\" is another common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:27.073105", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<green> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:05:27.073160", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:blade\nexplanation:With the feedback, I noticed that the letter \"L\" is present in the correct position (l<green>).
