This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:chin indentation<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:navel\nexplanation:The clue mentions \"chin indentation\", which made me think of another natural indentation in the human body - the belly button or navel. The word \"navel\" has 5 letters, and it seems like a plausible connection to the given clue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: n<red> a<red> v<red> e<yellow> l<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:INVALID_FORMAT\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nProvide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:level\nexplanation:Although the feedback indicates that \"n\", \"a\", and \"v\" are incorrect, I noticed that \"e\" and \"l\" appear in yellow, which suggests they might be present in the correct word. The clue mentions \"chin indentation\", and a level is often associated with a chin or jawline.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> v<red> e<red> l<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:leech\nexplanation:Despite the previous guess having multiple red letters, I noticed that \"l\" and \"e\" are still present in yellow, which suggests they might be important components of the correct word. The clue mentions  \"chin indentation\", and a leech is often found near the chin or jawline.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<red> e<green> c<yellow> h<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:leech\nexplanation:With the new feedback, I noticed that \"e\" has turned green, which means it's in the correct position! The clue still suggests a connection to the chin or jawline. Since \"c\" is yellow, it might be present in the word but not in the correct spot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<red> e<green> c<yellow> h<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:leech\nexplanation:Wait, I made a mistake! The feedback is the same as before, so my previous guess was incorrect. With  \"e\" being green and in the correct position, I'll try to build upon that. Since \"c\" is yellow, it might be present in the word but not in the correct spot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<red> e<green> c<yellow> h<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-e8e7f4f4-3984-47d2-9072-d3af32e3590a", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715883472, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--MaziyarPanahi--Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/4ece958b356f2ec00338e5898ba0a7254d976baf/./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:ledge\nexplanation:With \"e\" being green and in the correct position, I'll try to build upon that.
