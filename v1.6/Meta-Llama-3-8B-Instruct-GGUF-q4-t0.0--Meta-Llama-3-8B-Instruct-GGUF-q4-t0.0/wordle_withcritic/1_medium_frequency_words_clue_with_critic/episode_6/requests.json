A \"ledge\" could be used to describe the chin indentation, as it's a small ledge or groove in the skin.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> d<red> g<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:ledge\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I see that the letters \"l\" and \"e\" are correct but in the wrong position.

Since the clue is still \"chin indentation\", I'll try to come up with a new guess that fits this description.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> d<red> g<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:glebe\nexplanation:Since the letters \"l\" and \"e\" are correct but in the wrong position, I'll try to rearrange them with new letters.
