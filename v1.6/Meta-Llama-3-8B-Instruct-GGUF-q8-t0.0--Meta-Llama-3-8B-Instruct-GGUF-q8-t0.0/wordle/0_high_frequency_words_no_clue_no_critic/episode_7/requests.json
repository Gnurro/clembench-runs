This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:horse\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I see that \"h\" is incorrect (red), but \"o\", \"e\" are partially correct (yellow). The letters \"u\" and \"s\" are also incorrect (red). With this information, my next guess is a word that keeps the yellow letters in mind. I'm replacing the red letters with new ones to try to get more correct letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> r<red> s<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:holey\nexplanation:Since \"h\", \"r\", and \"s\" are still incorrect (red), I'm keeping the yellow letters \"o\" and \"e\" in mind. I'm replacing the red letters with new ones, trying to get more correct letters. The word \"holey\" seems like a good fit, as it keeps the yellow letters and introduces new possibilities for the other letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> l<red> e<green> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:lofty\nexplanation:With the feedback that  \"e\" is now green, I'm building on this correct letter. The letters \"h\", \"l\", and \"y\" are still incorrect (red), but I'll keep them in mind for future guesses. The word \"lofty\" seems like a good fit, as it keeps the green letter \"e\" and introduces new possibilities for the other letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<red> o<yellow> f<red> t<red> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:moles\nexplanation:Since all the letters except \"o\" are still incorrect (red), I'm focusing on keeping the yellow letter \"o\" and introducing new possibilities for the other letters. The word \"moles\" seems like a good fit, as it keeps the yellow letter \"o\" and introduces new letters that might be correct.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<red> o<yellow> l<red> e<green> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:modey\nexplanation:With the feedback that \"e\" is still green, I'm building on this correct letter again. The letters \"m\", \"l\", and \"s\" are still incorrect (red), but I'll keep them in mind for future guesses. The word \"modey\" seems like a good fit, as it keeps the green letter \"e\" and introduces new possibilities for the other letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
