This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<yellow> s<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I see that \"h\", \"o\", and \"e\" are not in the correct positions. However, \"u\" is present in the word, but not in the correct position. \"S\" is also not in the word. With this information, my next guess is a common five-letter word that has a different set of letters, while keeping \"u\" as a possibility.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:glide\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I see that all the letters in my previous guess (\"table\") are incorrect. The only correct letter from before is still \"u\". With this new information, I'm trying a different set of letters that include \"e\" and don't repeat any of the previously guessed letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<red> i<red> d<yellow> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:rupee\nexplanation:Again, all the letters in my previous guess (\"glide\") are incorrect except for \"d\" and \"e\". I'm trying to use these correct letters in a new combination. The word \"rupee\" is a valid five-letter English word that includes \"d\" and \"e\", and it's a good candidate for my next guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: r<red> u<yellow> p<red> e<green> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:route\nexplanation:With the feedback, I see that  \"u\" is present in the word, but not in the correct position. The letter \"e\" is correctly placed in the word, which is a good sign! I'm trying to use this information to my advantage by guessing another five-letter word that includes the correct \"e\" and the previously seen \"u\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: r<red> o<red> u<yellow> t<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:cubea\nexplanation:Again, all the letters in my previous guess (\"route\") are incorrect except for the correct placement of  \"e\". I'm trying to use this information to my advantage by guessing another five-letter word that includes the correct  \"e\" and the previously seen  \"u\", while avoiding the repeated letters from before.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
