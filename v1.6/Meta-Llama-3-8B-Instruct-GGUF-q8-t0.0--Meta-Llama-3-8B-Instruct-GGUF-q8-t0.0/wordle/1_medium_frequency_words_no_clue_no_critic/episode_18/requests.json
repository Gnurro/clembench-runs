You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:stems\nexplanation:Since all the letters in my previous guess were incorrect except for \"s\", I'm going to try to build on that. The feedback suggests that \"s\" is in the correct position, so I'll keep it there and replace the other letters with new ones. I've chosen \"stems\" because it's a common word that fits the given constraints and has a similar sound to \"house\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<yellow> e<red> m<yellow> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:steep\nexplanation:With the feedback, I see that \"s\" is in the correct position, and \"t\" and \"m\" are present but not in the right spot. I'll keep \"s\" as it is and try to move \"t\" and \"m\" around to find a better fit. The word \"steep\" seems like a good candidate since it has the correct letter \"s\", and the other letters are common enough to be plausible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<yellow> e<red> e<red> p<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:steat\nexplanation:Since all the letters except \"s\" were incorrect again, I'll try to keep the correct letter \"s\" and replace the other letters with new ones. The feedback suggests that  \"t\" is still present but not in the right position, so I'll keep it there as well. I've chosen  \"steat\" because it's a less common word that fits the given constraints and has a similar sound to my previous guesses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:stems\nexplanation:Since I couldn't find a suitable replacement for \"steat\", I'll go back to my previous guess that had some correct letters, \"stems\". This time, I'll try to modify it slightly to see if I can get closer to the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<yellow> e<red> m<yellow> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tests\nexplanation:This time, I'll replace the incorrect letters with new ones that fit the given constraints. The word \"tests\" seems like a good candidate since it has the correct letter \"s\", and the other letters are common enough to be plausible.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> e<red> s<yellow> t<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-fef3b0e2-1466-470a-8c33-0c167cc87a85", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715883281, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--MaziyarPanahi--Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/4ece958b356f2ec00338e5898ba0a7254d976baf/./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:stept\nexplanation:Since all the letters except \"s\" were incorrect again, I'll try to keep the correct letter \"s\" and replace the other letters with new ones.
