This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since \"house\" didn't work out, I'm going to try a new word that has the correct letter \"o\" in the right position (indicated by yellow), and avoid the letters \"h\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" which were all marked as red.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<green> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:angle\nexplanation:With the correct letter \"a\" in the right position (indicated by green), I'm going to try another word that builds upon this. I'll keep the correct letter \"a\" and avoid the letters \"t\", \"b\", \"l\", and \"e\" which were all marked as red.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> n<red> g<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:flake\nexplanation:Although the correct letter \"a\" is still present, its position has changed (indicated by yellow). I'll try to keep the correct letter \"a\" and avoid the letters \"n\", \"g\", \"l\", and \"e\" which were all marked as red. The word \"flake\" seems like a reasonable next guess, considering the feedback.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> l<red> a<yellow> k<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:lakea\nexplanation:Since the correct letter \"a\" is still present and its position has changed again  (indicated by yellow), I'll try to keep it in the same position. However, since all other letters were marked as red, I'll replace them with new ones that are more likely to appear in a five-letter word. The word \"lakea\" seems like a possible next guess, considering the feedback.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since my previous guesses didn't work out, I'll go back to an earlier attempt and modify it slightly. The word \"table\" was one of my early guesses, and I'll try a variation of it with the correct letter \"a\" in the same position (indicated by yellow).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<green> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-cdc2468f-3bf7-496b-b525-09149f076632", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715883292, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--MaziyarPanahi--Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/4ece958b356f2ec00338e5898ba0a7254d976baf/./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q8_0.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "I see that I'm back to a familiar feedback!\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Wait, what?
