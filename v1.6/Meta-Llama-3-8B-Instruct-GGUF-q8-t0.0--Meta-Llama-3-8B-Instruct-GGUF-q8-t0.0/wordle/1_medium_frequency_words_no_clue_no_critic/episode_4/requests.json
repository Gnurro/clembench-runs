You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in my previous guess were incorrect (red), I'm going to try a new word that has a different set of letters. The feedback indicated that the letter \"e\" is yellow, which means it's present in the target word but not in the correct position. I'll keep this in mind and try to use it in a different spot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:glide\nexplanation:Again, all the letters in my previous guess were incorrect (red), so I'll try a new word. The feedback still indicates that the letter \"e\" is yellow, which means it's present in the target word but not in the correct position. This time, I'll try to use it as part of a different word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<red> i<red> d<green> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:ridee\nexplanation:Ah-ha! The letter \"d\" is now green, which means it's in the correct position in the target word. I'll try to build on this success by keeping the letters that are already correct and adjusting the others. Since the letter \"e\" is still yellow, I'll keep it in the same spot, but change the surrounding letters to see if I can get a better fit.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
