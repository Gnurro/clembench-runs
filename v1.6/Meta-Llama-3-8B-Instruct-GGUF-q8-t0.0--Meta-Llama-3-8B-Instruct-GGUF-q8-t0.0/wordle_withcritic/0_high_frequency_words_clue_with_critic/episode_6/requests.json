At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\n\nPlease respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\nagreement:yes or no\nexplanation:your reason for doing so\n\nPlease note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\n\nLet's begin!\n\nclue:place to play\nguess:field\nexplanation:The clue \"place to play\" makes me think of a common place where people play, and \"field\" fits the description.\n\n\n\n\nclue:place to play\nguess:stage\nexplanation:Although my previous guess \"stage\" didn't match the word, the feedback suggests that the letter \"e\" is in the correct position.

You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.
