Analyze the target grid:\n   - The grid is 5x5\n   - The top row is completely filled with X's\n   - Each subsequent row has one more empty cell than the previous row\n   - The bottom row has only one X in the rightmost position\n\n2.", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-09-10 17:52:49.557781", "call_duration": "0:00:10.978125", "response": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the target grid and create a referring expression that distinguishes it from the two distractor grids.
