	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt nil\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - zero\\ \tt - nothing\\ \tt - naught\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <thinking>\\ \tt To solve this problem, I need to create a description for the target word "nil" without using the word itself or its related words. I should aim for a concise and clear description that will help the other player guess the word in as few attempts as possible. Let's break this down:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Understand the meaning of "nil":\\ \tt    - It represents the absence of quantity or amount.\\ \tt    - It's often used in sports scores or mathematical contexts.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. Think of alternative ways
