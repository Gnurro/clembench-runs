	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For instance, if your guess is "apple", your response should be\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt  explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.

	 <thinking>\\ \tt To solve this Wordle puzzle, I'll need to devise a strategy that maximizes the chances of guessing the word in as few attempts as possible. Here's my plan:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Start with a common five-letter word that contains a good mix of vowels and consonants.\\ \tt 2. Analyze the feedback after each guess.\\ \tt 3. Use the green letters as fixed positions in the next guess.\\ \tt 4. Incorporate yellow letters in different positions.\\ \tt 5. Avoid red letters in subsequent guesses.
