You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-10T16:24:48.124418", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "<thinking>\nTo solve this Wordle puzzle, I'll need to devise a strategy that maximizes the chances of guessing the word in as few attempts as possible.
