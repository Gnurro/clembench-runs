For this new guess, I've chosen a word that contains different letters, including some common consonants like \"s\", \"t\", and \"m\", as well as the vowel \"a\". This should help to identify if any of these letters are present in the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<red> m<yellow> p<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:flump\nexplanation:The previous guess \"stamp\" had all letters marked as red except for \"m\", which was yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position. For this new guess, I've chosen a word that keeps the letter \"m\" and introduces new letters to test. The word \"flump\" maintains the \"m\" and adds common letters like \"f\", \"l\", and \"u\" to gather more information about the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> l<yellow> u<red> m<yellow> p<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:clums\nexplanation:The previous guess \"flump\" had \"l\" and \"m\" marked as yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct positions. For this new guess, I've chosen a word that keeps both \"l\" and \"m\" and introduces new letters to test.
