        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:awaiting ignition<br/></p>

        <p>&lt;thinking&gt;<br/>To solve this Wordle puzzle, I&#x27;ll need to use the given clue and the feedback from each guess to make educated guesses. Let&#x27;s break down the process:<br/><br/>1. Analyze the clue: &quot;awaiting ignition&quot;<br/>2. Make an initial guess<br/>3. Use the feedback to refine subsequent guesses<br/>4. Continue until we find the correct word or run out of attempts<br/><br/>For the first guess, I&#x27;ll choose a word that relates to the concept of ignition or waiting for ignition</p>
