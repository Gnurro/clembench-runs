The word \"rooms\" is a common type of rental space, especially in shared housing or boarding situations. This guess maintains the yellow letter \"e\" from previous feedback, while introducing new letters that could potentially fit the target word. It also aligns more closely with the clue \"common rental\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: r<red> o<yellow> o<red> m<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:common rental\nguess:rooft\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the previous guess \"rooms\", I've retained the yellow letter \"o\" as it appears to be correct but in the wrong position.
