The second and third grids do not have the X in the middle row and middle column, so the first grid is the correct match.<|end_of_turn|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-18 16:11:58.298761", "call_duration": "0:00:03.279705", "response": "Answer: First\n\nThe expression describes a grid where the central X is surrounded by empty cells (▢) and is located in the middle row and middle column.
