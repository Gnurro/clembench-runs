	 Congratulations! You've guessed the target word correctly: "transplantation." You've demonstrated an understanding of the process and its significance in medical treatments.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's briefly discuss the related words:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Relocate: This term refers to moving from one place to another, which is not directly related to transplantation. However, it shares the idea of moving something from one place to another, albeit in a different context.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2
