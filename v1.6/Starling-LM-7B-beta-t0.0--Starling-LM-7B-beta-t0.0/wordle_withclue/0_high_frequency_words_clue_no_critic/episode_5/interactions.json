This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:woo\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T15:47:02.861076", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Guess: swan\nExplanation: The clue \"woo\" suggests a word related to courtship or attracting a partner, and swans are known for their elegant and romantic courtship displays.
