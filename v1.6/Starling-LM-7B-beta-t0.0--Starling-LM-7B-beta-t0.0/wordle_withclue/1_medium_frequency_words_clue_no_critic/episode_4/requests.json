This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:square\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:INVALID_FORMAT\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:quint\nexplanation:The clue \"square\" suggests a geometric shape, and \"quint\" is a term related to geometry, specifically referring to a five-sided polygon. Additionally, \"quint\" has five letters, which matches the target word's length.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: q<red> u<red> i<red> n<yellow> t<red><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:rhythm\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for \"quint,\" we know that the first two letters are incorrect (red), and the fourth letter is correct but in the wrong position (yellow). The clue \"square\" indicates a geometric shape, which can be associated with symmetry and balance, similar to the concept of rhythm in music. \"Rhythm\" has five letters, and the first two letters are different from those in \"quint,\" while the last three letters\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:rhyth\nexplanation:Considering the feedback for \"quint\" and the requirement for a five-letter word, I have shortened the previous guess \"rhythm\" to \"rhyth.\" The clue \"square\" suggests a sense of balance and symmetry, which can be associated with the smooth flow of rhythm in music. The first two letters are different from those in \"quint,\" and the last three letters are adjusted to fit the five-letter requirement\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: your guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:quart\nexplanation:The clue \"square\" implies a sense of balance and symmetry, which can be associated with the concept of a \"quart,\" a unit of measurement used in the wine industry to indicate a quantity equal to four bottles. This word has five letters, and the first two letters are different from those in \"quint,\" while the last three letters are adjusted to fit the five-letter requirement.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: q<red> u<red> a<red> r<yellow> t<red><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:pique\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for \"quart,\" we know that the first three letters are incorrect (red), and the fourth letter is correct but in the wrong position (yellow).
