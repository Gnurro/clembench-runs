You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T21:39:52.603773", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: crane\nexplanation: I choose \"crane\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter English word, and it contains different letters which will help to narrow down the possibilities.\n\nNow, please provide the feedback for this guess.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|>"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T21:39:52.603778", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "I choose \"crane\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter English word, and it contains different letters which will help to narrow down the possibilities."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T21:39:52.603816", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = swash\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<green> n<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Yi-1.5-34B-Chat)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "I choose \"crane\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter English word, and it contains different letters which will help to narrow down the possibilities.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T21:40:11.574279", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<green> n<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T21:40:11.574315", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:blade\nexplanation:From the feedback, we know that \"a\" is in the correct position (third letter).
