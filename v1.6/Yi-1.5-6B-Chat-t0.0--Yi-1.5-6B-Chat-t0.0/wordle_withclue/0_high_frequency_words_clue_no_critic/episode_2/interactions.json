You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:bronze place\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T00:59:40.717529", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: armor\nexplanation: The clue \"bronze place\" suggests a connection to a place that is often associated with bronze, such as ancient Greek or Roman landmarks. \"Armor\" is a valid English word of five lowercase letters that fits the theme of the clue, as bronze armor was historically used for protection.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|>"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T00:59:40.717533", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "armor", "explanation": "The clue \"bronze place\" suggests a connection to a place that is often associated with bronze, such as ancient Greek or Roman landmarks. \"Armor\" is a valid English word of five lowercase letters that fits the theme of the clue, as bronze armor was historically used for protection.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|>"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T00:59:40.717574", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = third\ntarget_word_clue = bronze place\nguess: armor\nguess_feedback: a<red> r<yellow> m<red> o<red> r<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "third", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Yi-1.5-6B-Chat)", "guess": "armor", "explanation": "The clue \"bronze place\" suggests a connection to a place that is often associated with bronze, such as ancient Greek or Roman landmarks. \"Armor\" is a valid English word of five lowercase letters that fits the theme of the clue, as bronze armor was historically used for protection.<|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|><|im_end|>", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bronze place"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T00:59:51.707567", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> r<yellow> m<red> o<red> r<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T00:59:51.707635", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Based on the feedback \"a<red> r<yellow> m<red> o<red> r<red>\", we can deduce the following:\n\n- The letter 'a' is incorrect, as indicated by the red color.\n- The letter 'r' is present in the word but in the wrong position, as indicated by the yellow color.\n- The letters 'm' and 'o' are not present in the target word, as indicated by the red color"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T00:59:51.707640", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T00:59:51.707660", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: Yi-1.5-6B-Chat) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "third", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Yi-1.5-6B-Chat)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT", "target_word_clue": "bronze place"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T01:00:02.853053", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-18T01:00:02.853090", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:bronze\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that none of the letters in \"armor\" are correct.
