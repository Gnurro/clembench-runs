The word \"pride\" also follows the five-letter constraint and is thematically linked to our clue. Let's see what feedback we get for this guess!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: p<red> r<yellow> i<red> d<red> e<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:pride\nexplanation:Interesting! We got one correct letter, \"e,\" in the right position (green). We also have one letter, \"r,\" that is in the word but in the wrong spot (yellow). Based on this feedback and our original clue about lions, let's try a word that still fits the theme.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: p<red> r<yellow> i<red> d<red> e<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:troop\nexplanation:\"Troop\" is another term for a group of lions and fits our five-letter constraint. The feedback from our previous guess,  \"pride,\" suggests that we have one correct letter, 'r,' but it needs to be in a different position within the word. Let's see if  \"troop\" gets us closer to the target word!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<red> r<yellow> o<red> o<red> p<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:pride\nexplanation:We know that 'r' is a correct letter, so I'm going to take another guess at a word related to lions in the hopes of finding other correct letters.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: p<red> r<yellow> i<red> d<red> e<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:manor\nexplanation:\"Manor\" is a word that relates to lions because of the popular Disney movie, \"The Lion King,\" where Simba lives in Pride Rock, which could be considered a manor. This guess also takes into account the feedback from our previous attempts and includes an  'r'   in a different position than before while trying new vowels as well<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: m<red> a<yellow> n<red> o<red> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:denote\nexplanation:\"Den\" is another word for the place where lions live, and it also means a room or space used for a specific activity. The feedback from our previous guess suggests that   'a'  and    'r' are correct letters but in the wrong positions (yellow). \"Denote\" includes these letters while introducing new vowels to help narrow down the target word<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters.
