I'm going to guess another word related to pictures and include an additional 't'. The new word will be \"frame\".<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: f<red> r<red> a<red> m<red> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:focus\nexplanation:Hmm, it seems like we're moving in the wrong direction.

Given the new constraint of a five-letter word limit and the previous feedback, I'm going to focus on the letters 'o' and 't'. The word \"shoot\" fits well with the picture/camera theme we've been exploring.

We know that  'h', and   'o' are in the correct positions, while \"s\" and \"t\" need to be switched. I'm going to guess a word that fits this pattern and is also related to cameras or pictures, so my next try will be \"smote,\" which means \"to strike or hit with a sudden powerful blow.\" Let's see if we can nail it this time!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> m<red> o<green> t<green> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-2c7c1d14-07d2-4b48-b162-e4db0e18634b", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715785501, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00002.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:photo\nexplanation:Almost there!
