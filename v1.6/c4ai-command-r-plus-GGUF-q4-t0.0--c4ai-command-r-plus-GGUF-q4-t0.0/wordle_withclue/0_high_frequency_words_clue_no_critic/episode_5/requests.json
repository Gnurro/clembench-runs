Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:woo<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:wooed\nexplanation:The clue \"woo\" indicates that the target word is likely related to romantic courtship or enticement, as in the act of \"wooing\" someone. I selected the word \"wooed,\" which means \"to pursue romantically.\" The feedback will help determine if this guess is on the right track!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: w<red> o<green> o<red> e<red> d<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:charm\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, only one letter was correct in the correct position (O). This indicates that our guess should focus more on words related to \"wooing\" and charming someone. The new guess is \"charm,\" which means a power or quality of delighting, fascinating, or attracting. It fits with the theme of courtship and has a similar vibe to \"woo.\" Let's see what the feedback reveals!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<green> h<red> a<red> r<green> m<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:allure\nexplanation:The feedback confirms that \"C\" and \"R\" are correct letters, but their positions need adjustment. This indicates we're on the right track with words related to charm and attraction. To continue in this direction while adjusting for letter placement, I'll guess \"allure,\" which means the power of being fascinating or attractive!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:amaze\nexplanation:Oops, my bad! Let's respect the rules and go with a five-letter word this time while still keeping in mind the theme we've established so far. The new guess is \"amaze,\" which means to surprise or wonder, often with delight—a bit like charming someone!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: a<red> m<red> a<red> z<red> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:swoon\nexplanation:That feedback tells us that none of our letters were correct. This could mean we need to pivot in a different direction while still keeping the theme of courtship and attraction in mind. So, I'm going with \"swoon,\" which means to be overwhelmed with emotion or romantic feeling—a reaction one might have when being charmed!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> w<red> o<yellow> o<red> n<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:crush\nexplanation:The feedback reveals that only \"O\" is a correct letter, but in the wrong position. This indicates we should shift our focus while keeping an eye on maintaining the central theme of romantic attraction and wooing. With this in mind, I’m going with  \"crush,\" which means a strong infatuation or brief but intense romantic feeling for someone!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<green> r<yellow> u<green> s<red> h<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-71425804-cf40-43a5-ae09-b8431ad775c0", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715785559, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00002.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:adore\nexplanation:The feedback confirms that  \"C\" and  \"U\" are correct letters, with the former in the right position.
