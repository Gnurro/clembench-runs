And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:common rental<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:lease\nexplanation:The word \"lease\" is associated with renting, which relates to the given clue of something that can be rented or leased out as a common practice. It also follows the pattern observed in the feedback where the correct letters appear scattered across the word rather than in sequence.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<red> e<yellow> a<red> s<red> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:money\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, none of the letters from \"lease\" are correctly placed and only one letter, E, is correct but in the wrong position. So I'm going to guess another five-letter word related to the clue 'common rental' that doesn't share any letters with our previous guess. The new word will include an  'e', as this was the only correct letter from our feedback<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: m<red> o<yellow> n<red> e<green> y<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:stays\nexplanation:Two letters, O and E are correct but misplaced. I will now try a word that includes these two letters in different positions while still relating to the clue of something that can be rented or leased for a temporary period. The new guess is \"stays.\" It describes a short-term rental, often referring to lodging at an inn or hotel<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<red> y<red> s<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:rents\nexplanation:None of the letters in \"stays\" were correct. I will now try another word associated with the clue  'common rental' but this time, I'll focus on a verb that describes the action of renting something and includes common letters that haven't been tried yet like R, N, T<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: r<red> e<yellow> n<red> t<red> s<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:hired\nexplanation:The letter E is correct but in the wrong position. I will now try another word associated with the clue  'common rental' that includes an   'e', while also taking into account the feedback from previous guesses and avoiding repeated letters or words with similar structures to those already tried<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: h<red> i<green> r<red> e<green> d<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:charter\nexplanation:The letters H, I, E are correct but misplaced while D is in the word but wrong position. The new guess \"Charter\" relates to renting or leasing something like a bus or plane for private use and includes the correct letters identified so far (H,I &E)<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters.
