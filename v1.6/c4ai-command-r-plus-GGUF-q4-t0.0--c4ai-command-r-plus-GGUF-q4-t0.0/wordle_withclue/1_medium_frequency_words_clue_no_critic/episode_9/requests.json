Here is a five-letter word that fits the previous strategy of keeping \"r\" and moving \"e\" to a different position while also introducing new vowels.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: w<red> r<yellow> u<red> n<yellow> g<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:swirl\nexplanation:With three yellow letters, we are close to the target word! The feedback suggests that \"r\" and all the subsequent letters are in the word but misplaced. I chose  \"swirl,\" which keeps these letters while introducing a new vowel yet again for more clues on our next attempt.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> w<red> i<green> r<yellow> l<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:wired\nexplanation:Now we know that \"i\" and  \"r\" are in the correct positions, so I chose a word with these letters while also including some new vowels to help narrow down our options. Let's see if this does the trick!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: w<red> i<yellow> r<yellow> e<yellow> d<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:riper\nexplanation:We are so close now! The feedback tells us that  \"i\" and   \"r\" are correct, with only the order of other letters remaining a mystery. My final guess is “riper,” which maintains these letters while introducing some new ones to fill in the gaps.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: r<green> i<yellow> p<red> e<yellow> r<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-2d8bd935-b2c6-4601-923b-fa7de39e9241", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715786062, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00002.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "Oh no!
