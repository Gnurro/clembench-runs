Arugula is a type of leafy green often used in sandwiches and salads, providing a slightly peppery taste. It's another guess with five letters that starts with a frequently used letter (\"a\"), which could be a good starting point for narrowing down potential words based on future feedback.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters.
