You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:repeater, maybe<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>clue:repeater, maybe\nguess:echoer\nexplanation:The word \"repeater\" makes me think of the concept of repetition or recurring actions/sounds. One word associated with this idea is \"echo,\" which fits the five-letter constraint and has a similar meaning to repeater. Additionally, the clue \"maybe\" suggests that there might be some level of uncertainty or possibility involved, which could align with the definition of \"echo\" as a reflection or replication of sound.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:chant\nexplanation:Given the constraint of a five-letter word, I'm thinking of words related to repetition and chanting often involves repeating phrases or sounds. The word \"chant\" also aligns with the clue's suggestion of uncertainty (\"maybe\") as chants are often used in situations where people are seeking something—a victory, a prayer answer, etc.—which may or may not occur<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:repeater, maybe\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:\"Chant\" fits well within the context provided by the clue. The word implies repetition and aligns with the speculative tone conveyed by \"maybe.\" Additionally, it adheres to the five-letter constraint mentioned in your instructions for this game.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:chant\nexplanation:You agreed that \"chant\" is a suitable guess based on the provided clue, so I will continue along this line of reasoning and provide a new guess that builds upon this idea.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> a<red> n<red> t<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:lyric\nexplanation:Since none of the letters in \"chant\" appeared in the target word, I will focus on the concept of repetition and try another word often associated with chants or repeated phrases. Lyrics are the words of a song that are meant to be sung or recited, fitting the clue's theme while offering a fresh set of letters for further refinement<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:repeater, maybe\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:The word \"chant\" fits well with the concept of repetition and uncertainty implied in the clue. Although none of the letters match, this could be due to an obscure answer or an error in my understanding so far. Let's proceed with this guess for now until we receive more information that may change our direction.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:chant\nexplanation:Given your agreement despite no matching letters revealed yet, I will maintain \"chant\" as the current line of reasoning while considering other possibilities based on the repetition and uncertainty themes conveyed by the clue. This approach allows us to balance exploring new paths with building upon existing hypotheses in a game like Wordle<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> a<red> n<red> t<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:stave\nexplanation:With no matching letters for \"chant,\" I will shift our focus while retaining the theme of repetition. A stave is a musical staff or set of five lines used to notate music, often containing repeated notes and rhythms. This guess introduces new letters that may provide more insight into the target word<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:repeater, maybe\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:None of the letters in \"chant\" are present, so it is unlikely to be correct. However, your new guess, \"lyric,\" introduces new letters and aligns with the theme of repetition in songs or chants. Let's see if any of these letters appear in the target word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:lyric\nexplanation:You suggested that my previous guess of \"stave\" shifts focus while retaining the repetition theme. However, given your disagreement and the absence of matching letters so far, I will follow your suggestion to explore  \"lyric\" as a new direction for our guesses. This introduces fresh letters and continues to align with the clue's repetitive nature<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<yellow> y<red> r<yellow> i<yellow> c<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:relay\nexplanation:The feedback on  \"lyric\" revealed one letter in the correct position (L) and three letters present but misplaced (R, I, C). Based on this information, our next guess should include these letters while changing the placement of R, I, and C. The word relay\" fits this pattern and conveys a sense of repetition or continuation as in a race with multiple participants taking turns<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:repeater, maybe\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the feedback indicates that only \"l\" is present, but misplaced. The other letters are not part of the word at all.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:loopy\nexplanation:Given your disagreement and the feedback on \"relay,\" we know that only the letter L appears in the target word but in a different position. To incorporate this knowledge while exploring new paths, I’ve selected  “loopy,” which includes an L in a different spot and conveys repetition through its suggestion of circularity or recurring thoughts<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<yellow> o<red> o<red> p<red> y<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:label\nexplanation:The feedback on  \"loopy\" revealed that only the letter L is present, but in a different position. My new guess of   “label” retains this letter while introducing fresh possibilities for matching letters. The word also aligns with repetition as labels are often repeated or replicated across products<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:repeater, maybe\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the feedback indicates that only \"l\" is in the correct word, but not in the right position. your guess does include an \"l\", however it also includes other letters which are incorrect according to the feedback provided for \"loopy\". therefore i disagree with this guess and suggest trying a different combination of the letters l, y, r, i or c<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:crier\nexplanation:Given that only L appeared in the correct position from our previous guesses, I'm going to focus on words featuring that letter. Crier\" fits within the theme of repetition as someone who cries out repeatedly and introduces a new set of letters while retaining R and I from earlier attempts<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> i<yellow> e<yellow> r<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:plier\nexplanation:The feedback on  \"crier\" revealed that only the letters R, I, and E are present but misplaced. My new guess of   “plier” retains these letters while introducing fresh possibilities for matching letters. The word also conveys repetition as pliers are used to repeatedly grip or hold objects<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:repeater, maybe\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the feedback indicates that only \"r\" is a correct letter, so we should try another word with more of these letters.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-429ac5af-0da8-4f1f-8d66-ecee999ec5f0", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715870433, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00002.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:rider\nexplanation:Given your disagreement and the limited matching letters revealed thus far (R), I will focus on words featuring multiple Rs to increase our chances of uncovering more correct letters or their positions. \"Rider” fits this criterion while also conveying repetition through its association with recurring journeys, trips, or paths", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1856, "completion_tokens": 62, "total_tokens": 1918}}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-16 14:40:33.131500", "call_duration": "0:00:15.790531", "response": "guess:rider\nexplanation:Given your disagreement and the limited matching letters revealed thus far (R), I will focus on words featuring multiple Rs to increase our chances of uncovering more correct letters or their positions. \"Rider” fits this criterion while also conveying repetition through its association with recurring journeys, trips, or paths", "model_name": "c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF-q4"}}}]
