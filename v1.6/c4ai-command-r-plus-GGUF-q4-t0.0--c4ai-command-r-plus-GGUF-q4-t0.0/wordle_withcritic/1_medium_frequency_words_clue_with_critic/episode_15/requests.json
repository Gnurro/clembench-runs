You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:crow<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:raven\nexplanation:Both ravens and crows are large black birds that are often considered ominous in stories, so I am guessing a word related to this clue. Ravens also have five letters which fit the criteria of the game.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:crow\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:Both \"raven\" and \"crow\" refer to large, black birds of the family Corvidae, and both are commonly associated with negative omens in stories and folklore. The word \"raven\" fits the required length for this game as well. This guess is reasonable based on the provided clue.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:raven\nexplanation:You agreed that \"raven\" was a good guess based on the clue, so I will keep it as my guess!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: r<red> a<yellow> v<red> e<red> n<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:vapor\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for \"raven,\" we know that only the letter 'a' is in the target word, and it isn't in the correct position. To maximize our chances of getting more letters right in their correct positions (green), I am now guessing a common five-letter word with 'a' as the second or third letter: vapor<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:crow\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:The word \"vapor\" does not contain an 'r'.

My new guess is carat—a unit of measurement for gemstones—as it contains an 'r' and is related to the clue because crows/ravens are sometimes associated with magic and mystical gems in fantasy stories<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> a<red> r<red> a<green> t<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:trait\nexplanation:The feedback for  \"carat\" reveals that only 'a' and 't' are correct, but they aren't in the right order. To get them in their proper places, I'm guessing trait as it has those letters next to each other while also including an 'r', which was previously confirmed by your feedback<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:crow\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:\"trait\" does not fit the clue \"crow.\" although it fits the guess feedback, we are looking for a word related to crows.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>clue:crow\nguess:screech\nexplanation:Based on your disagreement and our previous discussions, I'm guessing screech this time because it's associated with the loud, harsh sound often made by crows (and other birds). It also fits the pattern of having 'a' followed by 't', which we know from \"carat\" feedback.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters.

Crows are often associated with darkness and nocturnal activities, so my new guess is \"night,\" which represents the time when crows are typically most active<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:crow\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:while your guess of \"night\" follows logically from the clue, the feedback indicates that none of those letters appear in the correct word. it might be best to return to previous correct letters and try rearranging them or adding new ones while keeping their positions in mind.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:trait\nexplanation:Given our previous discussions and the confirmation of 'a' and  't', I'm returning to my earlier guess of \"trait.\" This word still fits the context of crows, as they are known for exhibiting certain behaviors or traits that humans might observe or associate with them.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<red> r<red> a<yellow> i<red> t<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:stray\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for  \"trait,\" we know that only 'a' and   't' are correct, but they aren't in the right order.
