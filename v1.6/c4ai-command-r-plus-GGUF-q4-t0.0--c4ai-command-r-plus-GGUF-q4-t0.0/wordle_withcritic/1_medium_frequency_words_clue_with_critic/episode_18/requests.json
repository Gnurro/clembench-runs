The feedback for your previous guess, \"raspy,\" confirmed that 'r' and 's' are correct letters but misplaced, so we should retain those while exploring new possibilities for the remaining vowels to find a word that better fits the context of \"sassy.\"<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:trust\nexplanation:\"Trust\" conveys confidence in someone or something. This guess retains two confirmed consonants (r and s) from your feedback on \"raspy,\" introducing different vowels this time around while maintaining our exploration within the framework of words associated with being bold, lively, or playful as per the initial clue's interpretation<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<red> r<yellow> u<red> s<yellow> t<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:smart\nexplanation:\"Smart,\" meaning clever and witty, captures the essence of someone who is  \"sassy.\" Given your feedback on   “trust,” we now have confirmation that two letters are correct with one correctly placed (r and t).
