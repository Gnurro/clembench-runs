This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:passionate<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:loves\nexplanation:The word \"loves\" is associated with strong feelings of passion or deep affection, which aligns with the given clue, \"passionate.\" It also adheres to the requirement of being a five-letter word. This initial guess will help narrow down the possibilities and provide feedback for subsequent guesses.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<red> o<red> v<red> e<yellow> s<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:crave\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, we know that only the letter \"e\" is in the target word but in a different position than my initial guess. To maximize our chances of getting more yellow and green letters this time around, I'll choose a word with multiple vowels including an \"e\", such as  \"crave.\" The new word also conveys strong desire or passion which fits well with the clue given initially<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> v<red> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:eager\nexplanation:Now that we know \"r\" and \"e\" are in the word, I’ll choose another word featuring these letters but with different positioning. The new guess is also related to the clue passionate as it describes someone who is keen or enthusiastically interested in something.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: e<yellow> a<red> g<red> e<red> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:fervor\nexplanation:With  \"r\" and  \"e\" confirmed, I’ll now focus on finding words that contain these letters in positions indicated by the feedback. The word fervor means intense heat or passion which is consistent with our original clue passionate while also containing the required letters at the correct spots<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:fever\nexplanation:\"fever\" fits well semantically with the initial clue, and it has the confirmed letter \"e\" in the third position as indicated by previous feedback. It also adheres to the five-letter constraint mentioned for this game of Wordle!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: f<green> e<yellow> v<red> e<red> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:freed\nexplanation:\"Freed\" is associated with liberation and intense emotions, somewhat connected to our original clue \"passionate.\" It also includes the confirmed letter  \"f,\" and previously identified letters   \"e\" and \"r\" in their correct positions.
