You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:swelter\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:08:54.637664", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: sweat \nexplanation: \"Sweat\" is associated with heat, which is the opposite of \"snowy.\" It also has five letters and starts with an \"s,\" like the word \"swelter.\" Let's see if this guess provides us with any useful feedback. \n\nNow we await feedback from Wordle to inform our next move!"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:08:54.637669", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "sweat", "explanation": "\"Sweat\" is associated with heat, which is the opposite of \"snowy.\" It also has five letters and starts with an \"s,\" like the word \"swelter.\" Let's see if this guess provides us with any useful feedback."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:08:54.637714", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = roast\ntarget_word_clue = swelter\nguess: sweat\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> w<red> e<red> a<yellow> t<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "roast", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF-q8)", "guess": "sweat", "explanation": "\"Sweat\" is associated with heat, which is the opposite of \"snowy.\" It also has five letters and starts with an \"s,\" like the word \"swelter.\" Let's see if this guess provides us with any useful feedback.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "swelter"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:09:03.427155", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<yellow> w<red> e<red> a<yellow> t<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:09:03.427267", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: steam\nexplanation: Based on the feedback, we know that the first letter is correct but in the wrong position and that the last letter is correct. \"Steam\" includes these letters while also relating to heat like our previous guess of \"sweat.\" It's also a word that could be associated with melting or evaporating due to extreme heat, which ties back to the clue \"swelter.\""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:09:03.427272", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "steam", "explanation": "Based on the feedback, we know that the first letter is correct but in the wrong position and that the last letter is correct. \"Steam\" includes these letters while also relating to heat like our previous guess of \"sweat.\" It's also a word that could be associated with melting or evaporating due to extreme heat, which ties back to the clue \"swelter.\""}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:09:03.427333", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = roast\ntarget_word_clue = swelter\nguess: steam\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> t<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> m<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "roast", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF-q8)", "guess": "steam", "explanation": "Based on the feedback, we know that the first letter is correct but in the wrong position and that the last letter is correct. \"Steam\" includes these letters while also relating to heat like our previous guess of \"sweat.\" It's also a word that could be associated with melting or evaporating due to extreme heat, which ties back to the clue \"swelter.\"", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "swelter"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:09:11.256674", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<yellow> t<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> m<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:09:11.256778", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:stray\nexplanation:With the feedback received so far, we can deduce that the word has an \"s\" and a vowel in it.
