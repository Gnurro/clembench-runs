This guess also adheres to the 5-letter word constraint and is a common word that may help with future guesses if it's incorrect.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: b<red> l<red> o<red> c<red> k<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:table\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, none of the letters from \"block\" are in the target word. So I will choose a new set of five common letters that represent another item which can be square-shaped - a table top or table cloth. This guess also follows the pattern of ending with a vowel and having at least one double letter to maximize information gain if it's incorrect again.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:chair\nexplanation:The feedback tells us that 'e' is in the target word but not in the position we guessed, and none of the other letters are correct. I will now choose another common 5-letter word related to squares - \"chair\". Many chairs have square seat cushions or backs, so this guess fits with the clue while also being a new combination of letters that may help narrow down the possibilities if incorrect again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> a<red> i<red> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:bench\nexplanation:The feedback tells us that 'r' is in the target word but not in the position we guessed, and all other letters are incorrect. At this point, I will choose another five-letter word related to squares in context of seating arrangements or furniture - \"bench\". Benches often have square corners and this guess includes some new letters while retaining  'r' at a different spot<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: b<red> e<green> n<yellow> c<red> h<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:stool\nexplanation:The feedback reveals that  'e' is in the correct position, and  \"n\" and   'r' are also part of the target word but in different positions. Now I will choose a five-letter word related to seating or furniture with these letters - “stool”. Many stools have square seats<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> o<red> o<red> l<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-d9a2e3f1-e9f7-4bdf-ba19-b13bbe641f5a", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715947273, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q8_0-00001-of-00003.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:frame\nexplanation:This feedback indicates that none of the letters in \"stool\" are correct.
