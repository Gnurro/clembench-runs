The word “style” can refer to a distinctive appearance or character and is often associated with grace, elegance, and poise—all qualities that might be employed while wooing someone.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> t<yellow> y<red> l<red> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:crush\nexplanation:\"Style\" didn't contain any correct letters in their guessed positions, so I will only retain \"r\" and \"c\", which we know are part of the word. Someone might develop a  “crush” on another person during courtship or while being wooed; it conveys a similar sentiment to our original clue but with a different nuance.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:woo\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:\"crush\" does not contain the letter 'o' from the word \"woo\".<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:crown\nexplanation:I will keep \"r\" and \"c\", which we know are in the target word, but change my strategy a bit. The word “crown” is something that can be given or bestowed upon someone, similar to how one might bestow affection during courtship.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<green> r<yellow> o<yellow> w<red> n<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:croon\nexplanation:\"Crown\" had two correct letters in incorrect positions and the first letter right; I retained all three of these letters for my next guess. To  “croon” means to speak or sing softly and lovingly, which is something one might do while wooing their beloved. This word also fits with our known letters: c, r, o<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:woo\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:\"croon\" does not fit the guess feedback as it has an extra \"o\".
