You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:mosaic artist's material<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:glass\nexplanation:Mosaic artists often work with glass tiles to create their artwork; \"glass\" fits the five-letter requirement for Wordle and matches the clue of a mosaic artist's materials.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:mosaic artist's material\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:\"Glass\" is indeed a common material used by mosaic artists, and it fits the five-letter constraint. This guess aligns with the given clue.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:slags\nexplanation:Based on your agreement that glass could be the correct word, I will now try to rearrange its letters while keeping in mind that the first letter is correct but the other instances are not placed correctly according to the feedback. \"Slags\" is a five-letter rearrangement of \"glass,\" with the first letter 's' being incorrect and the remaining letters needing adjustment.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> l<red> a<red> g<yellow> s<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:smalt\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, we know that only \"g\" is correct but in the wrong position from your previous guess of  \"slags.\" The new guess, \"smalt,\" retains this letter while changing the other letters. Smalt is a blue glass powder used by artists for coloring, which also fits with the clue about artistic materials.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:mosaic artist's material\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:The guess \"glass\" does not match the feedback provided after your initial attempt. While glass is indeed a material used by mosaic artists, it doesn't fit with the letter constraints given in the feedback. It's important to consider both the clue and the feedback when making guesses.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>clue:mosaic artist's material\nguess:smalts\nexplanation:Since you disagreed with my previous guess of \"glass,\" I will now focus on words that include an  'm'. My new guess is \"smalts.\" This word relates to the artistic material theme, as smalt is a deep blue glass used in decorative arts and painting.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:smelt\nexplanation:Adjusting my strategy based on your feedback about the word length, I'm now focusing on five-letter words related to artistic materials that include an 's' and an 'm'. Smelt is a collective term for various items of metalware or metalworking tools. It fits the five-letter constraint while retaining the 's' and 'm' from previous attempts.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> m<red> e<red> l<red> t<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:talcs\nexplanation:Given that only 't' was correct in your feedback, I will now try variations of the word  \"smelt\" while retaining this letter. My new guess is   \"talcs,\" which is a rearrangement of the letters from  \"smelt\" with an additional  'c'. Talc is a soft mineral used as a filler by artists and could fit within the theme of artistic materials.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:mosaic artist's material\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:The guess feedback indicates that only \"t\" was correct, so we should look for another word with this letter in it and discard the other letters. We can also assume from the clue that the answer is a type of material used by mosaic artists. Talc does not fit either of these criteria as per your explanation; therefore, I disagree with this guess.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:tilts\nexplanation:Based on your disagreement regarding  \"talcs,\" and considering we need to include   't' in the word while focusing on materials for mosaic art, my new guess is    \"tilts.\" This could relate to tiling or creating a level surface, which are both relevant concepts when crafting mosaics.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<yellow> i<red> l<red> t<red> s<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:tints\nexplanation:Given that only the letter  \"t\" is correct but in the wrong position, I will retain this letter and modify my guess accordingly. My new guess is   \"tints,\" which relates to colors or shades of paint used by artists for mixing and creating different effects.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:mosaic artist's material\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the feedback indicates that only \"t\" is a correct letter, but it's in the wrong position; therefore, your guess does not match the feedback. You should make another guess based on this new information to find the correct word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:toner\nexplanation:Based on the feedback that only  \"t\" is correct but misplaced and considering our theme of artistic materials, my next guess is   \"toner.\" Toner could refer to a type of ink or pigment used in printing or drawing.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<yellow> o<yellow> n<red> e<red> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:otter\nexplanation:Given that  \"t,\" \"o,\" and   \"r\" are correct but misplaced, I will retain these letters in my next guess. My new attempt is    \"otter.\" Although it doesn't directly relate to artistic materials, there could be a connection through paintbrushes or other tools with animal-themed names.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:mosaic artist's material\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the feedback indicates that only \"t\" is in the word and correctly placed, so we should focus on words related to mosaic art that include this letter.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:tiler\nexplanation:Given your disagreement with my previous guess of   \"otter,\" I will now concentrate on terms directly linked to mosaics while retaining the correct placement of  't'. My new suggestion is    \"tiler.\" A tiler is someone who lays tiles, which are often used in mosaic artwork.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<yellow> i<red> l<red> e<red> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:trite\nexplanation:Based on the feedback that   \"t\" and  \"r\" are correct but misplaced while    'i', 'l' and 'e' are incorrect, I will retain only these two letters for my next guess. My new suggestion is     \"trite,\" which means lacking originality or freshness in expression - a concept somewhat related to the creative process of art.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:mosaic artist's material\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:The feedback indicates that only \"t\" and \"r\" are correct letters, but they are in the wrong positions. Your guess does not follow this pattern as it includes an additional \"t.\" You should make another guess based on the provided feedback to find a word with only these two correct letters in different positions while changing the other letters.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-fa64ca2d-ef15-46df-a4b8-536d43b61bc8", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715952146, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q8_0-00001-of-00003.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:trout\nexplanation:Considering your disagreement and focusing on words related to artistic materials that include   \"t\" and    \"r\" in different positions, I now suggest  \"trout.\" This could refer to a paintbrush style or type of tool used by artists for creating unique textures.", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1886, "completion_tokens": 61, "total_tokens": 1947}}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 13:22:26.500285", "call_duration": "0:00:16.236617", "response": "guess:trout\nexplanation:Considering your disagreement and focusing on words related to artistic materials that include   \"t\" and    \"r\" in different positions, I now suggest  \"trout.\" This could refer to a paintbrush style or type of tool used by artists for creating unique textures.", "model_name": "c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF-q8"}}}]
