You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-19T12:55:21.620290", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: aaaaa\nexplanation: I'm starting with all As as a placeholder guess to see if the word begins with A and to gauge the length of the target word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-19T12:55:21.620295", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "aaaaa", "explanation": "I'm starting with all As as a placeholder guess to see if the word begins with A and to gauge the length of the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-04-19T12:55:21.620309", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD while parsing Player 1's (model: command-r) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (command-r)", "guess": "aaaaa", "explanation": "I'm starting with all As as a placeholder guess to see if the word begins with A and to gauge the length of the target word.", "error": "NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-04-19T12:55:22.438544", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "your guess is not a valid word for this game.
