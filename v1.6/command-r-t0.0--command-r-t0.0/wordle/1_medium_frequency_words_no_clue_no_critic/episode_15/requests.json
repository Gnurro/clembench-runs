You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}, {"role": "CHATBOT", "message": "guess:aaaaa\nexplanation:I'm starting with all vowels as there are many 5-letter words that begin with them, and it's a good starting point to narrow down the possibilities.\n"}, {"role": "USER", "message": "your guess is not a valid word for this game.
