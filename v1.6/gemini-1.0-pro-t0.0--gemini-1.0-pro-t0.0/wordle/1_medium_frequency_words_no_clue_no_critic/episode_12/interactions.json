You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:49:04.388733", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: arise\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and it contains three vowels, which increases the chances of getting some feedback."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:49:04.388741", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "arise", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and it contains three vowels, which increases the chances of getting some feedback."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:49:04.388782", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = fiery\nguess: arise\nguess_feedback: a<red> r<yellow> i<yellow> s<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "fiery", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemini-1.0-pro)", "guess": "arise", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and it contains three vowels, which increases the chances of getting some feedback.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:49:06.125038", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> r<yellow> i<yellow> s<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:49:06.125112", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:irate\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"r\", \"i\", and \"e\" are in the word, but not in the correct positions.
