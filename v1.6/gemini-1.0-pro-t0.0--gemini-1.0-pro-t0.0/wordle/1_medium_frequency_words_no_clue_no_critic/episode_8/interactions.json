This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:48:11.114857", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: arise\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and it contains three vowels, which increases the chances of getting some feedback."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:48:11.114865", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "arise", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and it contains three vowels, which increases the chances of getting some feedback."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:48:11.114906", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = trial\nguess: arise\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> r<green> i<green> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "trial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemini-1.0-pro)", "guess": "arise", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and it contains three vowels, which increases the chances of getting some feedback.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:48:12.828068", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> r<green> i<green> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T06:48:12.828144", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:irate\nexplanation: The feedback tells us that \"a\", \"r\", and \"i\" are correct letters, and \"a\" is in the correct position.
