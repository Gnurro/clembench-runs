This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."]}, {"role": "model", "parts": ["guess:arise\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and it contains three vowels, which increases the chances of getting some feedback.\n"]}, {"role": "model", "parts": ["guess_feedback: a<yellow> r<green> i<green> s<red> e<red>"]}, {"role": "model", "parts": ["guess:irate\nexplanation:The feedback tells us that \"a\", \"r\", and \"i\" are correct letters, and \"a\" is in the correct position.
