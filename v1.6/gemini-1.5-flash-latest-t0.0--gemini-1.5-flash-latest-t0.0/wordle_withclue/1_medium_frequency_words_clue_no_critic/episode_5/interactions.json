You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:mosaic artist's material\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T07:04:55.146354", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: tiles\nexplanation: Mosaic artists use tiles to create their artwork, and the word \"tiles\" has five letters. \n"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T07:04:55.146363", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "tiles", "explanation": "Mosaic artists use tiles to create their artwork, and the word \"tiles\" has five letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T07:04:55.146403", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = grout\ntarget_word_clue = mosaic artist's material\nguess: tiles\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> i<red> l<red> e<red> s<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemini-1.5-flash-latest)", "guess": "tiles", "explanation": "Mosaic artists use tiles to create their artwork, and the word \"tiles\" has five letters.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "mosaic artist's material"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T07:04:56.150737", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> i<red> l<red> e<red> s<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-19T07:04:56.150811", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: stone\nexplanation: Since \"tiles\" was incorrect, we need to consider other materials used in mosaics. \"Stone\" is a common material for mosaics, and it has five letters.
