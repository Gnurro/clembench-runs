You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:18:33.633758", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: adieu\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word with a variety of vowels, which will help determine which vowels are present in the target word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:18:33.633768", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "adieu", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word with a variety of vowels, which will help determine which vowels are present in the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:18:33.633823", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = video\nguess: adieu\nguess_feedback: a<red> d<yellow> i<yellow> e<green> u<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "video", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemini-1.5-pro-latest)", "guess": "adieu", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word with a variety of vowels, which will help determine which vowels are present in the target word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:18:55.725533", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> d<yellow> i<yellow> e<green> u<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:18:55.725627", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:yield\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'e' is the correct letter in the fourth position and 'd' and 'i' are present in the word but in different positions.
