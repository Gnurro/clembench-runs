You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:59:34.661068", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: crane\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word with a variety of vowels and consonants, which will help me gather information about the target word's composition."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:59:34.661077", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word with a variety of vowels and consonants, which will help me gather information about the target word's composition."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:59:34.661131", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = gloat\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "gloat", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemini-1.5-pro-latest)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word with a variety of vowels and consonants, which will help me gather information about the target word's composition.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:59:56.726735", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-21T16:59:56.726833", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:focal\nexplanation: The feedback from \"crane\" indicates that the letter \"a\" is in the word but not in the third position.
