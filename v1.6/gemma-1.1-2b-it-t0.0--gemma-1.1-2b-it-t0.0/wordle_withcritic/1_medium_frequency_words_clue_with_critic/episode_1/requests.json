And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:not very intelligently<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nclue:not very intelligently\nguess:INVALID_FORMAT\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nProvide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nguess:blind\nexplanation:The word should contain the letters \"not\" and \"blind\" in a non-obvious way.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nclue:not very intelligently\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:The word should contain the letters \"not\" and \"blind\" in a way that suggests a lack of intelligence, but not in a blatantly obvious way.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nclue:not very intelligently\nguess:sly\nexplanation:The word should contain the letters \"sly\" and have a subtle meaning that is not immediately obvious.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
