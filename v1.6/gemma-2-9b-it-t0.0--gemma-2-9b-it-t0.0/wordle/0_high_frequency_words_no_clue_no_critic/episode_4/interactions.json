You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:46.379145", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:  crane\nexplanation:  This word uses common consonants and a vowel, aiming for a good distribution of letters. \n\n\n"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:46.379149", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "This word uses common consonants and a vowel, aiming for a good distribution of letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:46.379173", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = might\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemma-2-9b-it)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "This word uses common consonants and a vowel, aiming for a good distribution of letters.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:48.631514", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:48.631546", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:  light\nexplanation:  Since none of the letters in \"crane\" were correct, I'm choosing a word with common vowels and consonants not used in the previous guess. \n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:48.631549", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "light", "explanation": "Since none of the letters in \"crane\" were correct, I'm choosing a word with common vowels and consonants not used in the previous guess."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:48.631573", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = might\nguess: light\nguess_feedback: l<red> i<green> g<green> h<green> t<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemma-2-9b-it)", "guess": "light", "explanation": "Since none of the letters in \"crane\" were correct, I'm choosing a word with common vowels and consonants not used in the previous guess.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:49.551404", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<red> i<green> g<green> h<green> t<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:49.551434", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: light\nexplanation:  We got all the letters!  \n\n\n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:49.551437", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "light", "explanation": "We got all the letters!"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:49.551461", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 3\ntarget_word = might\nguess: light\nguess_feedback: l<red> i<green> g<green> h<green> t<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 3, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemma-2-9b-it)", "guess": "light", "explanation": "We got all the letters!", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:51.393261", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<red> i<green> g<green> h<green> t<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:18:51.393293", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:  light\nexplanation:  It seems I made a mistake and repeated the previous guess.
