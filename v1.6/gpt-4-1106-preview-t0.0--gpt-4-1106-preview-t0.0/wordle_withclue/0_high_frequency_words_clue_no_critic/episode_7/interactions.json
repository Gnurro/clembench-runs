You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:common rental\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:43:37.463525", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: lease\nexplanation: A lease is a common form of rental agreement for property or equipment, and it is a five-letter word that fits the clue."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:43:37.463534", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "lease", "explanation": "A lease is a common form of rental agreement for property or equipment, and it is a five-letter word that fits the clue."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:43:37.463575", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = video\ntarget_word_clue = common rental\nguess: lease\nguess_feedback: l<red> e<yellow> a<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "video", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4-1106-preview)", "guess": "lease", "explanation": "A lease is a common form of rental agreement for property or equipment, and it is a five-letter word that fits the clue.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "common rental"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:43:40.004629", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<red> e<yellow> a<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-09T12:43:40.004730", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: fleet\nexplanation: Given that the letter 'e' is in the word but not in the second position, I am trying it in the fourth position.
