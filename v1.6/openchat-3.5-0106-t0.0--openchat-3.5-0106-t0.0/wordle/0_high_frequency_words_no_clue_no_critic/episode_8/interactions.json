You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:44.900404", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:44.900408", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:44.900444", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = their\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat-3.5-0106)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:46.442429", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:46.442483", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:orange\nexplanation: Since the previous guess had all red feedback, I need to change all the letters. \"Orange\" is another common five-letter English word, and it has one yellow letter from the previous feedback."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:46.442487", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "orange", "explanation": "Since the previous guess had all red feedback, I need to change all the letters. \"Orange\" is another common five-letter English word, and it has one yellow letter from the previous feedback."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:46.442500", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: openchat-3.5-0106) response, retrying", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat-3.5-0106)", "guess": "orange", "explanation": "Since the previous guess had all red feedback, I need to change all the letters. \"Orange\" is another common five-letter English word, and it has one yellow letter from the previous feedback.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T10:49:48.054536", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
