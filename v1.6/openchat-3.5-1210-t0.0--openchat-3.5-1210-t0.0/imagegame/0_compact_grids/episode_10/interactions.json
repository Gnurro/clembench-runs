You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next instruction?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving instructions. When you have described everything, you say \"DONE\".\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n\nY ▢ ▢ ▢ Y\nY ▢ ▢ ▢ Y\nY ▢ ▢ ▢ Y\nY Y Y Y Y\nY Y Y Y Y\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T11:54:38.810415", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Instruction: Place an X in the first row, second column"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T11:54:38.810555", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": "Instruction: Place an X in the first row, second column", "original_content": "Instruction: Place an X in the first row, second column"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 2", "timestamp": "2024-03-11T11:54:38.810585", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Let us draw something together.
