Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nC C C C C\nC C C C C\nC C C C C\nC C C C C\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the first row, second column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the second row, third column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the third row, fourth column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the fourth row, first column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the fourth row, second column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the fourth row, third column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the fourth row, fourth column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the fourth row, fifth column<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: DONE<|end_of_turn|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-03-11 11:53:06.051920", "call_duration": "0:00:00.238571", "response": "Instruction: DONE", "model_name": "openchat-3.5-1210"}}}]
