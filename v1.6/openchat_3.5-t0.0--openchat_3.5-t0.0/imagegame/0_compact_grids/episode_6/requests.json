Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n\n▢ J J J ▢\nJ J J J J\nJ J J J J\n▢ J J J ▢\n▢ J J J ▢\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the top right corner.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the bottom left corner.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the top left corner.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the bottom right corner.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the middle of the top row.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the middle of the bottom row.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the middle of the second row.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: Place an X in the middle of the fourth row.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: What is your next instruction?<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: Instruction: DONE<|end_of_turn|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-04-26 17:56:02.877344", "call_duration": "0:00:00.203357", "response": "Instruction: DONE", "model_name": "openchat_3.5"}}}]
