You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-03-26T16:17:42.506942", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: house\nexplanation: I chose \"house\" as my first guess because it is a common English word with five letters, and it follows the criteria of being a valid English word with only lowercase letters.
