You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-13T14:45:03.371810", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "I'm excited to play Wordle!\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, hoping to get some correct letters in the right positions.\n\nPlease provide the feedback for my first guess!"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-13T14:45:03.371815", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, hoping to get some correct letters in the right positions."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-13T14:45:03.371844", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = photo\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "photo", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GGUF-q4)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, hoping to get some correct letters in the right positions.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-13T14:45:08.807226", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<yellow> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-13T14:45:08.807318", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: hoard\nexplanation: From the feedback, I see that \"h\" and \"o\" are present in the target word but not in the correct positions.
