The word \"frame\" fits the 5-letter requirement and includes the letter \"e\", so I'm hoping to get closer to the target word this time.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> r<yellow> a<red> m<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:prime\nexplanation:With the feedback, I see that the letter \"r\" is now marked yellow, indicating it's in the correct word but not in the right position. The clue \"square\" and the presence of both \"e\" and \"r\" make me think of a prime number, which can be represented on a number line with square markers. The word \"prime\" fits the 5-letter requirement and includes both \"r\" and \"e\", so I'm hoping<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> r<yellow> i<red> m<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:remez\nexplanation:Although the word \"prime\" didn't quite fit, I noticed that the letters \"r\" and \"e\" are still present in the correct word. The clue \"square\" made me think of a rectangle, which is a type of quadrilateral with four right angles, similar to a square. I associated this with the word \"remez\", a less common word that fits the 5-letter requirement and includes both \"r\" and \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.

With the letters \"r\" and \"e\" still present in the correct word, I'll try a new approach. The clue \"square\" makes me think of a square shape's perimeter, which led me to the word \"meter\".
