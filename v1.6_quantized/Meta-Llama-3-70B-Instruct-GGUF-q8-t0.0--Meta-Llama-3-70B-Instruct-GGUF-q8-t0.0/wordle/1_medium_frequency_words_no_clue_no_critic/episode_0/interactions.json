This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:44.239495", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "I'm excited to play Wordle!\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, hoping to get some correct letters in the right positions.\n\nPlease provide the feedback for my first guess!"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:44.239499", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, hoping to get some correct letters in the right positions."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:44.239548", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = axial\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "axial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GGUF-q8)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, hoping to get some correct letters in the right positions.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:48.854361", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:48.854454", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "No luck with my first guess!\n\nguess: bread\nexplanation: Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'm trying a new word that has a different set of common letters. \"Bread\" is another familiar five-letter word that might give me some correct hits."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:48.854459", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "bread", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'm trying a new word that has a different set of common letters. \"Bread\" is another familiar five-letter word that might give me some correct hits."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:48.854495", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = axial\nguess: bread\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "axial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-GGUF-q8)", "guess": "bread", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"house\" were incorrect, I'm trying a new word that has a different set of common letters. \"Bread\" is another familiar five-letter word that might give me some correct hits.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:54.378913", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-15T21:14:54.378991", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:angel\nexplanation:Although most of the letters in \"bread\" were incorrect, the letter \"a\" was marked yellow, indicating it's present in the target word but not in the correct position.
