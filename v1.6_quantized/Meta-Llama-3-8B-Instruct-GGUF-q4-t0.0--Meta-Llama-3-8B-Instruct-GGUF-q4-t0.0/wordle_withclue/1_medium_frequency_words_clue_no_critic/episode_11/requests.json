Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:file<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:pile\nexplanation:The clue mentions \"file\", which makes me think of a physical file or document. A \"pile\" is a collection of papers or documents, so it's a reasonable connection. Additionally, the word \"pile\" has 4 letters, but I'll assume that<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:filed\nexplanation:Building on the clue \"file\", I'm going to guess a word that is related to filing or documents. The word \"filed\" has 5 letters and seems like a plausible connection.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> i<red> l<red> e<yellow> d<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:elite\nexplanation:Since the letter \"e\" is present in the correct word, I'm going to guess a word that is related to excellence or superiority. The word \"elite\" has 5 letters and fits the pattern of the feedback.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: e<yellow> l<red> i<red> t<red> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:lease\nexplanation:With the letter \"e\" being in the correct position, I'm going to build on that and try to find a word that is related to the clue \"file\". The word \"lease\" has 5 letters and seems like a plausible connection. Additionally, the feedback suggests that the letters \"l\", \"i\", and \"t\" are not present in the correct word, so I'll exclude those from my next guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<red> e<yellow> a<red> s<red> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:lease\nexplanation:Despite the previous feedback suggesting that the letters \"l\", \"a\", and \"s\" are not present in the correct word, I'm going to reuse the word  \"lease\" because of the strong connection with the clue  \"file\". The letter \"e\" is still present in the correct position, and I'll try to build on that.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<red> e<yellow> a<red> s<red> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:theme\nexplanation:The clue \"file\" makes me think of a theme or a category, so I'm going to take a chance with this word. The letter \"e\" is still<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> h<red> e<green> m<red> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-c4d86824-7420-4dc7-a4b4-a2a4569073f8", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715883533, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--MaziyarPanahi--Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/4ece958b356f2ec00338e5898ba0a7254d976baf/./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:theme\nexplanation:Despite the previous feedback suggesting that the letters \"t\", \"h\", and \"m\" are not present in the correct word, I'm going to reuse the word \"theme\" because of the strong connection with the clue \"file\".
