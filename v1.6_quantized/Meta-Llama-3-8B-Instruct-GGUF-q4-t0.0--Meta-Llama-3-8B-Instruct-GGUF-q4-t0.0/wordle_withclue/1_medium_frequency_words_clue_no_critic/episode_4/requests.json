This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:square<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:shape\nexplanation:The clue \"square\" makes me think of geometric shapes, and \"shape\" is a word that fits perfectly within this context. It also has 5 letters, which matches the length requirement for the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> h<red> a<red> p<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:square\nexplanation:Since the clue is \"square\", I'll try to use a word that's closely related to it. \"Square\" itself has 6 letters, but I can modify it by<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:space\nexplanation:The clue \"square\" makes me think of a related concept, and \"space\" is a word that fits within this context. It has 5 letters, which matches the length requirement for the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> p<red> a<red> c<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:state\nexplanation:Although \"space\" didn't quite fit, I noticed that the letter \"e\" was yellow in the feedback. This makes me think of words related to \"square\" or \"space\", and \"state\" is a word that comes close. It has 5 letters, which matches the length requirement for the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<red> t<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:steep\nexplanation:Despite \"state\" not being the correct answer, I noticed that the letter \"e\" is still yellow in the feedback. This makes me think of words that have a similar sound or meaning to \"square\", and \"steep\" comes close. It has 5 letters, which matches the length requirement for the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> e<yellow> e<red> p<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tease\nexplanation:Although \"steep\" didn't quite fit, I noticed that the letter \"e\" is still yellow in the feedback. This makes me think of words that have a similar sound or meaning to \"square\", and \"tease\" comes close. It has 5 letters, which matches the length requirement for the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> e<green> a<red> s<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-b9a3f81f-42c0-4c36-b052-f00e865da3e1", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715883447, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--MaziyarPanahi--Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF/snapshots/4ece958b356f2ec00338e5898ba0a7254d976baf/./Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "A breakthrough!\n\nguess:tease\nexplanation:With the letter \"e\" now green, I'm going to build upon this new information.
