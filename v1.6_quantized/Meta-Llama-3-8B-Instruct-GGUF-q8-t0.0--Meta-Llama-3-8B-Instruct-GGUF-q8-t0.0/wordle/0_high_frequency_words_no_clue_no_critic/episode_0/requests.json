You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:stems\nexplanation:Since all the letters in my previous guess were incorrect except for \"s\", I'm going to try to build on that. The feedback suggests that \"s\" is in the correct position, so I'll keep it there and replace the other letters with new ones. I've chosen \"stems\" because it's a common word that fits the given constraints and has a similar sound to \"house\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<green> e<red> m<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:steps\nexplanation:With two correct letters, \"s\" and \"t\", I'm going to try to build on that. The feedback suggests that both of these letters are in the correct position, so I'll keep them there. I've replaced the other letters with new ones, choosing  \"steps\" because it's a common word that fits the given constraints and has a similar sound to my previous guesses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<green> e<red> p<red> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:stint\nexplanation:Since I already have two correct letters, \"s\" and \"t\", in the correct positions, I'll try to build on that. The feedback suggests that the new letter \"p\" is incorrect, so I'll replace it with a different one. I've chosen \"stint\" because it's a common word that fits the given constraints and has a similar sound to my previous guesses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<green> i<red> n<red> t<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:stein\nexplanation:With three correct letters,  \"s\", \"t\", and \"t\", I'm going to try to build on that. The feedback suggests that the new letter \"i\" is incorrect, so I'll replace it with a different one. I've chosen \"stein\" because it's a common word that fits the given constraints and has a similar sound to my previous guesses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<green> e<red> i<red> n<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:steiny\nexplanation:Since I already have three correct letters,  \"s\",  \"t\", and  \"t\", in the correct positions, I'll try to build on that.
