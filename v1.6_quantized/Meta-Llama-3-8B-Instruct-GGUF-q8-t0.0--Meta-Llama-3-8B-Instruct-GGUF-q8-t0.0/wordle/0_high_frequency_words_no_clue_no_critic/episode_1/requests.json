This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:horse\nexplanation:With the feedback, I see that \"h\" and \"s\" are in the correct positions (yellow), while \"o\" and \"u\" are not present at all (red). The letter \"e\" is also present, but not in the correct position. Since \"house\" was a good starting point, I'll try to modify it by replacing the incorrect vowels (\"o\" and \"u\") with another common vowel combination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> r<yellow> s<yellow> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:hoise\nexplanation:With the new feedback, I see that \"h\", \"s\", and \"e\" are still in the correct positions (yellow), while \"o\" is not present at all (red). The letter \"r\" has appeared, which is also yellow. Since \"horse\" was a good modification from my previous guess, I'll try to keep the same letters and replace the incorrect vowel (\"o\") with another common vowel combination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> i<red> s<yellow> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:holey\nexplanation:With the new feedback, I see that  \"h\", \"s\", and \"e\" are still in the correct positions (yellow), while \"o\" and \"i\" are not present at all (red). Since my previous guess was close, I'll try to modify it by replacing the incorrect vowels (\"o\" and \"i\") with another common vowel combination.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> l<red> e<yellow> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:holey\nexplanation:Wait, I already guessed \"holey\" earlier! Since the feedback is similar to my previous guess, I'll try to modify it by replacing the incorrect letters  (\"l\", \"o\", and \"y\") with other common letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> l<red> e<yellow> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:holem\nexplanation:Since the feedback is similar to my previous guess, I'll try to modify it by replacing the incorrect letters (\"l\", \"o\", and \"y\") with other common letters. I'll replace \"y\" with an \"m\", which is a common letter combination in many words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
