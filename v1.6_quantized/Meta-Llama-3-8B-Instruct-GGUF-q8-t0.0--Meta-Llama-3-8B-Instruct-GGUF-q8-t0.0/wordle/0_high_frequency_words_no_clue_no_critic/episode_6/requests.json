You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in my previous guess were incorrect (red), I'm going to try a new word that has a different set of letters. The feedback indicated that the letter \"e\" is yellow, which means it's present in the target word but not in the correct position. I'll keep this in mind and try to use it in a different spot.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<green> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:angle\nexplanation:With the feedback that the letter \"l\" is green, which means it's in the correct position, I'll try to build on this. The letters \"t\", \"a\", and \"b\" were all red, so I'll avoid those. The letter \"e\" was yellow again, so I'll keep trying to use it in a different spot. The word \"angle\" seems like a good fit, given the correct placement of the letter \"l<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> n<red> g<red> l<green> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:glebe\nexplanation:Again, all the letters except \"l\" were red, so I'll try to avoid them. The letter \"e\" was yellow again, and I'll keep trying to use it in a different spot. Since \"l\" is green and in the correct position, I'll build on that. The word \"glebe\" seems like a good fit, given the correct placement of the letter \"l\" and the presence of the letter \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<yellow> e<green> b<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:gleam\nexplanation:With the feedback that the letter \"l\" is yellow, which means it's present in the target word but not in the correct position, I'll try to move it around. The letters \"g\", \"b\", and one of the \"e\"s were red, so I'll avoid those. The other \"e\" was green, which means it's in the correct position! I'll build on that and try to use the letter \"l\" in<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<yellow> e<green> a<red> m<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:leane\nexplanation:With the feedback that the letter \"e\" is green and in the correct position, I'll keep it there. The letters \"g\", \"m\", and one of the \"a\"s were red, so I'll avoid those. The letter \"l\" was yellow, which means it's present in the target word but not in the correct position. I'll try to move it around and see if I can get a better fit. The word \"le<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
