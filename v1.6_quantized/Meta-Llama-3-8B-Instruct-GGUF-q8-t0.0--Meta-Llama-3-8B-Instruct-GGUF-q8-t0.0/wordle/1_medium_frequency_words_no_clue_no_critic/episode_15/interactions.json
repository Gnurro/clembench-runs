You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:13:58.702090", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "I'm excited to play Wordle!\n\nguess: house\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.\n\nPlease provide the feedback!"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:13:58.702094", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:13:58.702124", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = gloat\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "gloat", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF-q8)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants. \"House\" seems like a reasonable place to start, and it's easy to remember.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:14:00.106011", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:14:00.106069", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Since \"house\" didn't work out, I'm going to try a new word that has the correct letter \"o\" in the right position (indicated by yellow), and avoid the letters \"h\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" which were all marked as red."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:14:00.106073", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since \"house\" didn't work out, I'm going to try a new word that has the correct letter \"o\" in the right position (indicated by yellow), and avoid the letters \"h\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" which were all marked as red."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:14:00.106102", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = gloat\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "gloat", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF-q8)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since \"house\" didn't work out, I'm going to try a new word that has the correct letter \"o\" in the right position (indicated by yellow), and avoid the letters \"h\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" which were all marked as red.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:14:02.036890", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-16T18:14:02.036946", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:My previous guess \"table\" had some correct letters, so I'm going to build upon that.
