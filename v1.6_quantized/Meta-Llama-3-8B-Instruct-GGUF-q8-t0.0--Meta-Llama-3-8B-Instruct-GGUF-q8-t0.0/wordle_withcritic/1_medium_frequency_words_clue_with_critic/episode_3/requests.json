This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:hospital supply<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:nurse\nexplanation:The clue mentions \"hospital\", which makes me think of a profession often associated with hospitals, and the word \"nurse\" has 5 letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:hospital supply\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the guess \"nurse\" does not seem to be directly related to the hospital supply, it's more related to the people working in a hospital.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:medic\nexplanation:The clue mentions \"hospital supply\", which makes me think of medical equipment and supplies.
