The new guess,  \"praise,\" is another term associated with commendation or acclaim for an achievement, often used in phrases like “words of praise” or “high praise.” It also introduces several new letters to potentially narrow down the options further and get closer to the target word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters.
