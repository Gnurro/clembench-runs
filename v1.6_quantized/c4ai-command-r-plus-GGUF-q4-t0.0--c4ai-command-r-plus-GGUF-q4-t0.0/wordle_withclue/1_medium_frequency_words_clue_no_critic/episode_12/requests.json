Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:passionate<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:loves\nexplanation:Love is often described as a deep, intense feeling of passionate affection. The word \"loves\" fits the criteria of being a 5-letter word and will help determine if any of the letters in the word are correct.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<red> o<red> v<red> e<yellow> s<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:anger\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, neither \"l\", \"o,\" nor \"v\" appears in the target word, so I will exclude these letters from my next guess. The letter \"e\" is correct but in the wrong position and \"s\" does not appear at all; as a result, I will focus on words that include an \"e\" but do not end with an \"s\". The clue \"passionate\" can be associated with emotions like anger or joy<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: a<red> n<red> g<red> e<yellow> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:fervor\nexplanation:The letters \"a,\" \"n,\" and \"g\" are not in the target word, so I will continue to exclude them. The letters \"er\" appear together but in a different order than my previous guess; this could mean that these letters are correct but need to be rearranged. Keeping all of this information in mind directs me towards the word  \"fervor,\" which also means intense passion or enthusiasm<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:ardor\nexplanation:My previous guess, \"fervor\", broke the rule that the target word must be five letters long; my new choice is a similar word with the correct length—ardor. This word still takes into account the feedback from our previous exchanges and fits the clue of  \"passionate.\"<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: a<red> r<yellow> d<red> o<red> r<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:choir\nexplanation:At this point, I know that only  \"r\" is in the target word but in a different position. To make my next guess, I will focus on words with an  \"r\" in them and avoid any of the letters that have been marked as incorrect so far (a, d, o). The clue passionate can be linked to singing in a choir<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> o<red> i<yellow> r<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:brave\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from my last guess and the letters that have been ruled out so far, I know we need to focus on words with an \"i\" and an  \"r.\" The clue passionate can be associated with bravery. Thus, brave fits these criteria while also being a word with five letters<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> a<red> v<red> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-a44e15ae-637e-4608-ad7f-c28fd0db6fdf", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715786199, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00002.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:tryst\nexplanation:The letters  \"i\" and   \"r\" are confirmed to be in the target word, but their positions need to be rearranged.
