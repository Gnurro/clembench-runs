You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess.

It can also refer to a large, square piece of something hard material used for building, like concrete or stone. The word \"block\" satisfies the five-letter requirement and relates to the clue \"square.\"<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:square\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:\"Block,\" with its definition referring to a solid shape cut into a cube or square, aligns with the provided clue of \"square.\" Additionally, it meets the criteria of being a five-letter word. Thus, your guess is reasonable and logically connected to the given clue.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:brick\nexplanation:Based on our mutual agreement that \"block\" was a good initial guess for the word related to \"square,\" I'm going to continue along those lines but with a slightly different material in mind this time. A \"brick\" is a small rectangular block typically made of fired or sun-dried clay and used in building construction. It also has five letters, which meets our requirements.

It fits our theme while avoiding repetition of previously used letters.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:square\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:While \"slate\" does refer to square pieces, it doesn't fit the guess feedback as it contains the letter 'b' which is marked red (wrong). We need a word that has an 'r' in place of 'b', and doesn't contain any other letters from the previous guess.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:plaza\nexplanation:Given your disagreement with my previous guess, I will now focus on words containing 'r' while avoiding the letters from my previous guesses (brick and slate). The word \"plaza\" means an open, public square in a town or city, often surrounded by buildings and usually paved. It fits our theme of squares/blocks and contains the letter we are targeting ('r').<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: p<red> l<red> a<red> z<red> a<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:quilt\nexplanation:Given that none of my previous letters were correct, I will now shift away from the \"brick/block\" theme and focus on finding another five-letter word related to squares. A  \"quilt\" is a type of bedding made by stitching together layers of padding between two pieces of cloth. Quilts are often designed with square patches or sections, hence relating back to our clue while avoiding previously used letters (b, r, p, l, a,<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:square\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:\"Quilt\" does not match the guess feedback, which indicates that none of the letters are correct. We need to find another word related to squares with different letters than those in \"quilt.\"<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:patch\nexplanation:Given your disagreement and considering our previous guesses, I will now focus on a different aspect of squares while avoiding the letters from my previous attempts (brick, slate, plaza, quilt). A \"patch\" is a small piece or section of material used to repair or reinforce a worn or torn part. In quilting, individual fabric pieces are often sewn together in square patterns to create larger designs, thus relating back to our clue and adhering to the five-letter constraint.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: p<red> a<red> t<red> c<red> h<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:rhomb\nexplanation:Given that none of my previous letters were correct, I will now focus on identifying another word related to squares while avoiding repetition from all prior guesses. A \"rhomb\" is a parallelogram with four equal sides and four equal angles; it's also known as a diamond shape or a square tilted by 45 degrees. This guess aligns with the clue of “square” but uses entirely different letters, which might help us narrow down the correct answer.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:square\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:While \"rhombus\" does refer to a square with diagonals that form an 'X' shape, your guess of \"rhomb\" is not a word.

A  \"knoll\" is a small, round hill or mound that often resembles half of a sphere protruding from the ground. It brings to mind concepts like dimensions (length, width, height), which are integral to squares as well.

An \"axial\" shape has to do with or relating to an axis. In geometry, squares have bilateral symmetry along their vertical and horizontal axes.
