And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:pic<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:stall\nexplanation:My first guess is \"stall.\" The word relates to the clue, \"pic,\" as in \"picture,\" which you might display or hang on a wall after purchasing it from a street vendor's stall. This guess will also help me understand the word's letter composition and whether any letters are repeated.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> t<yellow> a<red> l<red> l<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:stream\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, we know that only 't' is in the correct position from our previous guess \"stall.\" To maximize the chances of getting more yellow and green squares, I will choose a word with multiple instances of 't.' The word \"stream\" has two 't's and also meets the five-letter requirement.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:trait\nexplanation:Apologies for not adhering to the word limit; that was an oversight! Adjusting my strategy, I will now select a word with just one 't' and some new letters to test their presence in the target word. The guess \"trait\" fits this criterion while still including the confirmed letter 't.'<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<yellow> r<red> a<red> i<red> t<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:light\nexplanation:With only one yellow square for 't', we can deduce that the target word does not have any of the other letters from our previous guess, \"trait.\" My new suggestion is  \"light,\" which introduces three new letters while retaining the confirmed letter 't.' This will help us gather more information about the composition of the mystery word.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: l<red> i<red> g<red> h<yellow> t<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:chute\nexplanation:Now we know that both 'h' and  't' are in the target word but in different positions than in our previous guess, \"light.\" To build upon this knowledge, I will choose a word with these letters in new spots. The word   \"chute\" fits this strategy while also introducing three fresh letters to test for potential matches or exclusions.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> h<green> u<red> t<green> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:thyme\nexplanation:The feedback confirms that  'h' and   't' are in the target word, with    'h' being in the correct position. To build on this information, I will choose a word that includes these letters while introducing new ones to test their presence or absence. The guess \"thyme\" fits this strategy well by keeping the confirmed letters and adding three more to potentially narrow down our options further.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<yellow> h<green> y<red> m<red> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-efdc2886-66bc-4ed5-85be-739e13351086", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715946769, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q8_0-00001-of-00003.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:chest\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, we can confirm that  'h' is in the correct position and   't' is present but misplaced from our previous guess, \"thyme.\" To maximize the chances of getting more green or yellow squares, I will choose a word with multiple instances of these letters.
