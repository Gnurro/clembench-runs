And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:others'<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:other\nexplanation:The apostrophe in \"others'\" indicates a possessive form, which could suggest that the word has some connection to the root word \"other.\" Thus, \"other\" is a good starting point as it embodies the clue directly and contains five letters.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: o<red> t<yellow> h<yellow> e<yellow> r<green><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:mother\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, we know that the letter  'r' is correct in the last position. This narrows down our options and suggests a possible pattern of consonants preceding it. \"Mother\" fits this pattern while also relating to the original clue about something belonging to others or being comparative in nature (\"other\").<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:smote\nexplanation:The feedback reveals that the first letter is not \"o,\" and we already know that \"r\" is correct for the last position. Smote fits this pattern, with a vowel at the beginning followed by consonants, ending in \"r.\" It also loosely connects to the idea of 'others' or a plural form indicating multiple entities.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> m<red> o<red> t<yellow> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:crate\nexplanation:With three out of five letters being incorrect, we need to change our strategy while retaining the correct letters  't' and 'e'. \"Crate\" is a good guess as it starts with a consonant-vowel pattern that has not been explored yet. Additionally, the word still relates to the original clue by representing a container or an enclosed space for multiple items (others).<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> t<yellow> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:stare\nexplanation:Now that we know   't' and  'e' are correct but in the wrong positions, it's time to focus on words with these letters in different sequences. \"Stare\" fits this criterion while also beginning with an  's,' which was previously guessed to be correct but actually isn't. This guess tests whether our initial assumption about   's' being correct was simply a coincidence or if there is another pattern at play.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: s<red> t<yellow> a<red> r<yellow> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:trite\nexplanation:At this stage, we have exhausted many possible combinations of the letters  't' and   'e'. The guess \"trite\" maintains these letters while introducing new vowels. It also aligns with the original clue as something that could be described as commonplace or overused (others/multiple).<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: t<green> r<yellow> i<yellow> t<red> e<yellow><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-7fb64631-d200-4519-b3bb-67c7c38b9210", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715946995, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q8_0-00001-of-00003.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:tiger\nexplanation:Now we know   't' is in the correct position, so our next guess should focus on words with  \"t\" as the first letter.
