The previous feedback on \"praise\" confirmed that only the letters \"h\" and \"r\" are correct, but we can use this information moving forward in subsequent guesses.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:bronze place\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:The word \"medal\" fits the clue well as bronze is a type of medal given for third place, and it has five letters.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:badge\nexplanation:Badges are similar to medals and are often awarded or bestowed upon someone as an honor or recognition. It follows the same line of thought as my previous guess \"medal,\" but introduces new letters that might be part of the target word, especially if \"badge\" receives feedback indicating correct letters or positions.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: b<red> a<red> d<yellow> g<red> e<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:honor\nexplanation:\"Honor\" is often used to describe the recognition one receives for an achievement, which aligns with the idea of being awarded a bronze medal or placing third. The feedback on  \"badge” retained only the letter   “d,” suggesting that we should focus on words containing this letter in the same position while exploring new combinations around it.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:bronze place\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:The word \"honor\" fits well with the theme of recognition and accolades, as one is often honored for their achievements or placed in a position of respect. While the guess feedback on \"badge\" retained only the letter \"d,\" it doesn't necessarily mean that other letters are incorrect; they might just be in the wrong positions. Thus, I agree with your current guess while considering potential adjustments based on future feedback.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:medal\nexplanation:Medals are commonly awarded for accomplishments or victories and come in various forms like gold, silver, and bronze. This guess reintroduces some letters from previous attempts (such as  \"m,\"   \"l,\" and    \"a\") while retaining the letter     \"d\" in its original position based on feedback from your last guess (\"badge\").<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>guess_feedback: m<red> e<red> d<yellow> a<red> l<red><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>guess:award\nexplanation:\"Award” is synonymous with prize, honor, or recognition for merit and fits the context of accolades. The previous feedback on  \"medal\" didn't confirm any exact letter matches but indicated that   “d\" is in the correct position; hence my new guess retains this letter placement while introducing different letters to narrow down possibilities further.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>clue:bronze place\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:\"medal\" fits with your clue of 'bronze place' and is a good initial guess, as medals are often awarded for first, second or third places.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": {"id": "cmpl-788d0b34-d199-4714-b54e-e6dbeb1eea9e", "object": "text_completion", "created": 1715950431, "model": "/data/jordan/huggingface_cache/models--pmysl--c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF/snapshots/8d3d3290d3ec11559da21ac2fd66262676ef81b9/./command-r-plus-Q8_0-00001-of-00003.gguf", "choices": [{"text": "guess:third\nexplanation:Third place is typically associated with receiving a bronze medal in many competitions; hence the word   \"third” could be an apt guess based on this clue while introducing new letters that might provide additional feedback to hone in on the target word.", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1622, "completion_tokens": 53, "total_tokens": 1675}}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-17 12:53:51.666948", "call_duration": "0:00:14.153057", "response": "guess:third\nexplanation:Third place is typically associated with receiving a bronze medal in many competitions; hence the word   \"third” could be an apt guess based on this clue while introducing new letters that might provide additional feedback to hone in on the target word.", "model_name": "c4ai-command-r-plus-GGUF-q8"}}}]
