You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:37.825465", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:37.825469", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:37.825491", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = serum\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "serum", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:40.330069", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:40.330102", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: eleph\nexplanation: The feedback for \"apple\" indicated that none of the letters were in the correct position, so I eliminated all the letters that appeared in the first guess. \"Eleph\" is a valid English word, and the letter \"e\" was the only yellow letter in the feedback for \"apple\", so it is a good choice for the next guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:40.330105", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "eleph", "explanation": "The feedback for \"apple\" indicated that none of the letters were in the correct position, so I eliminated all the letters that appeared in the first guess. \"Eleph\" is a valid English word, and the letter \"e\" was the only yellow letter in the feedback for \"apple\", so it is a good choice for the next guess."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:40.330116", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD while parsing Player 1's (model: openchat_3.5) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "serum", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "eleph", "explanation": "The feedback for \"apple\" indicated that none of the letters were in the correct position, so I eliminated all the letters that appeared in the first guess. \"Eleph\" is a valid English word, and the letter \"e\" was the only yellow letter in the feedback for \"apple\", so it is a good choice for the next guess.", "error": "NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T21:36:41.987337", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "your guess is not a valid word for this game.
