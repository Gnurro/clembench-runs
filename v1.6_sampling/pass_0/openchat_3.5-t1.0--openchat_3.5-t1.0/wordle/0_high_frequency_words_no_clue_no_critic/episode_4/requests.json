This change will provide new information for adjusting my guesses.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: c<red> h<yellow> a<red> r<red> t<green><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for \"chart\", I can conclude that the correct letters in the word are 't' and 'r', and 'a', 'h', and 'c' are incorrect. As \"chart\" includes the correct letters 't' and 'r', I will maintain these letters in my next guess. The incorrect letters 'a', 'h', and 'c' will be replaced with other letters that could be part of the target word\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: c<red> h<yellow> a<red> r<red> t<green><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for \"chart\", I can conclude that the correct letters in the word are 't' and 'r', and 'a', 'h', and 'c' are incorrect.
