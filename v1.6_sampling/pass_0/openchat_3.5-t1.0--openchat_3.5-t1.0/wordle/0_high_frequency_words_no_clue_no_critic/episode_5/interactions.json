You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:49.201336", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a simple word to start with and contains a variety of different letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:49.201340", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a simple word to start with and contains a variety of different letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:49.201362", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = court\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a simple word to start with and contains a variety of different letters.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:51.278959", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:51.278988", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: star\nexplanation:Based on the previous feedback indicating that none of the letters in \"apple\" were correct, I have chosen a completely different word that also has five letters. \"Star\" is a common five-letter English word and doesn't share any letters with \"apple\", which may yield more meaningful feedback."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:51.278992", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "star", "explanation": "Based on the previous feedback indicating that none of the letters in \"apple\" were correct, I have chosen a completely different word that also has five letters. \"Star\" is a common five-letter English word and doesn't share any letters with \"apple\", which may yield more meaningful feedback."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:51.279001", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: openchat_3.5) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "star", "explanation": "Based on the previous feedback indicating that none of the letters in \"apple\" were correct, I have chosen a completely different word that also has five letters. \"Star\" is a common five-letter English word and doesn't share any letters with \"apple\", which may yield more meaningful feedback.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:50:53.222978", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
