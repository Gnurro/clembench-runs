This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word, hoping it covers some common letter patterns.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:flier\nexplanation:The feedback for the first guess indicated that the letters 'a', 'p', 'p', 'l', and 'e' were incorrect. The letter 'e' was the only one to provide any information, suggesting that it may be in the correct position. Therefore, I have chosen the word 'flier', which contains the only given correct letter in the correct position and has no repeating letters.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: f<red> l<red> i<red> e<yellow> r<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:flier\nexplanation:Considering the feedback for the second guess, which indicated that the letters 'f', 'l', 'i', 'e', and 'r' were incorrect, I will maintain the word 'flier', as it only contains the correct letter 'e' in the correct position.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: f<red> l<red> i<red> e<yellow> r<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:fire\nexplanation:The feedback for the guess 'flier' indicated that the letters 'f', 'l', 'i', 'e', and 'r' were incorrect. However, the word 'fire' contains these letters in the correct positions, and it is a common five-letter English word. Therefore, I have chosen 'fire' as my new guess.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:fire\nexplanation:Considering the feedback for the second guess, which indicated that the letters 'f', 'l', 'i', 'e', and 'r' were incorrect, I am maintaining the word 'fire', as it is a common five-letter English word. However, I missed the constraint that the word should have exactly 5 letters. I initially overlooked this condition and thought it was a typo. I apologize for the mistake.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:pire\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, I understand that the word should be exactly 5 letters long. I have chosen the word 'pire', which is not a valid English word, to satisfy this condition. However, it still contains the correctly placed letters 'l' and 'e' from the feedback.<|end_of_turn|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-06-06 12:52:45.282247", "call_duration": "0:00:02.317947", "response": "guess:pire\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the previous guesses, I understand that the word should be exactly 5 letters long.
