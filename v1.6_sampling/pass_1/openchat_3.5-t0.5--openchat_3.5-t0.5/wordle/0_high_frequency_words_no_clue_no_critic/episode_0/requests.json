You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is easy to remember and has a mix of vowels and consonants.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the previous guess, I can see that none of the letters in \"apple\" were correct. Therefore, I need to choose a new word with different letters. \"Chart\" is a common five-letter English word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, and it is not similar to \"apple.\"\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> a<green> r<green> t<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:I noticed that the feedback for \"chart\" showed that the letters \"a\" and \"r\" were correct, while the letters \"c\" and \"h\" were incorrect. However, the letter \"t\" was yellow, indicating that it is in the correct position but not the correct letter. Therefore, I will keep \"t\" and replace the incorrect letters \"c\" and \"h\" with a new letter that is not yet used in the word\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> a<green> r<green> t<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:I noticed that the feedback for \"chart\" showed that the letters \"a\" and \"r\" were correct, while the letters \"c\" and \"h\" were incorrect.
