Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:The feedback from the previous guess indicates that the first letter 'a' and the fourth letter 'l' are correct but in the wrong position, so I will replace 'a' with 'c' and 'l' with 't' to form the word 'chart'.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> a<yellow> r<yellow> t<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:The feedback from the previous guess indicates that the first letter 'c' and the second letter 'h' are incorrect, while the third and fourth letters 'a' and 'r' are correct but in the wrong position, and the fifth letter 't' is correct.
