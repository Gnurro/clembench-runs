You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:59:05.722998", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: arter\nexplanation: I chose this word because it contains only lowercase letters, and it has a mix of vowels and consonants, which makes it a reasonable starting point."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:59:05.723002", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "arter", "explanation": "I chose this word because it contains only lowercase letters, and it has a mix of vowels and consonants, which makes it a reasonable starting point."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:59:05.723014", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD while parsing Player 1's (model: openchat_3.5) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "arter", "explanation": "I chose this word because it contains only lowercase letters, and it has a mix of vowels and consonants, which makes it a reasonable starting point.", "error": "NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T12:59:07.108220", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "your guess is not a valid word for this game.
