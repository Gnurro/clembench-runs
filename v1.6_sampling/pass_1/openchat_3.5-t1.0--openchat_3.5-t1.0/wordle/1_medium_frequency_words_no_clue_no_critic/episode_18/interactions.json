You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:05:24.302919", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a simple and commonly used word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:05:24.302922", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a simple and commonly used word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:05:24.302960", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = smart\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "smart", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a simple and commonly used word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:05:27.360835", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:05:27.360876", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:books\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the first guess, I can see that the letter 'a' was a yellow (incorrect letter in the correct position), 'p' was a red (incorrect letter in the correct position), and 'l' and 'e' were red (incorrect letters in any position).
