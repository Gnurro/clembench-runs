You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:12:19.177398", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word since it is easy to remember and contains some of the most frequently used letters in the English language."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:12:19.177402", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word since it is easy to remember and contains some of the most frequently used letters in the English language."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:12:19.177426", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = fiery\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "fiery", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word since it is easy to remember and contains some of the most frequently used letters in the English language.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:12:21.492160", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:12:21.492191", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: eagle\nexplanation: The previous guess received no green feedback, so I should choose a word that has at least one correct letter in the correct position.
