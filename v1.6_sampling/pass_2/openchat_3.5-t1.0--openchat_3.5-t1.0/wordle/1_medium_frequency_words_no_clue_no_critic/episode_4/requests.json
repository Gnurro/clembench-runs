I chose \"eagle\" as the next guess, as it has five letters and 'e' was identified as being in the correct word but in the wrong position in the previous feedback.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: e<yellow> a<red> g<red> l<red> e<red><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:leap\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, it seems that 'a', 'g', and 'l' were incorrect in all instances. However, 'e' was correct but in the wrong position. Therefore, I chose \"leap\" as the next guess, as 'e' is in a different position and 'l' is a common letter in English words. Additionally, 'p' is a common letter that hasn't been used yet.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:leaf\nexplanation:Apologies for the previous guess that exceeded the required word length. I chose \"leaf\" as the new guess, as it has five letters, and the letter 'e' was identified as being correct but in the wrong position in the previous feedback. This guess allows for the possibility of 'e' in a different position and 'l' is a common letter in English words.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: the word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:eel\nexplanation:Once again, I apologize for the prior guess that didn't meet the specified word length. I chose \"eel\" as the next guess, as it has five letters and the letter 'e' was identified as being correct but in the wrong position in the previous feedback. This guess focuses on a different position for 'e' and introduces the common letter 'l'.\n<|end_of_turn|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-06-06 13:10:28.219086", "call_duration": "0:00:02.738094", "response": "guess:eel\nexplanation:Once again, I apologize for the prior guess that didn't meet the specified word length.
