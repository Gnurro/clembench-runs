This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<red><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:elephant\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the first guess, I removed the letters \"a\", \"p\", and \"l\" since they were either incorrect or in the wrong position.
