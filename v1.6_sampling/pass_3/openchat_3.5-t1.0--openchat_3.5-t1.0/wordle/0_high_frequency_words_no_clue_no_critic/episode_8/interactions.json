You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:55.174276", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:55.174280", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:55.174304", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = their\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:57.338562", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:57.338592", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: fox\nexplanation: The first guess \"apple\" did not match any letters in the correct positions, so I am switching to a different five-letter word that is easier to spell. \"Fox\" is a common English word and has none of the letters from the previous guess, increasing the chances of revealing new information."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:57.338596", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "fox", "explanation": "The first guess \"apple\" did not match any letters in the correct positions, so I am switching to a different five-letter word that is easier to spell. \"Fox\" is a common English word and has none of the letters from the previous guess, increasing the chances of revealing new information."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:57.338606", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: openchat_3.5) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "fox", "explanation": "The first guess \"apple\" did not match any letters in the correct positions, so I am switching to a different five-letter word that is easier to spell. \"Fox\" is a common English word and has none of the letters from the previous guess, increasing the chances of revealing new information.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:16:59.394687", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
