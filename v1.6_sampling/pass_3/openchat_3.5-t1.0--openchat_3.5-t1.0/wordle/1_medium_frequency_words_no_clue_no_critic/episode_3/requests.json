You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for \"apple\", the letters 'a', 'p', 'p', and 'l' were incorrect. The only correct letter was 'e', which is in the second position. I decided to replace all the letters in my first guess with new ones, except for the 'e', to maximize the chance of finding the correct word.

However, the letter 'r' was in the correct position, since it was yellow. I decided to replace the incorrect letters with new ones, while keeping the 'r' in the correct position. The word \"shade\" has the 'r' in the correct position, and two other correct letters, 'e' and 'd', in the correct positions as well.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: s<green> h<red> a<red> d<red> e<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:shade\nexplanation:Based on the feedback for \"shade\", the letters 's', 'a', and 'd' were incorrect, but the letter 'e' was yellow, meaning it is in the correct position. The only correct letter was 'h', which is in the first position. I decided to keep the 'h' and 'e' in their positions since they are correct, and replace the 's', 'a', and 'd' with new\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: s<green> h<red> a<red> d<red> e<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:shade\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that 's', 'h', 'a', 'd', and 'e' are all incorrect.
