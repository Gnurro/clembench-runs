You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:45.367600", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:45.367604", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:45.367625", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = grout\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:47.212254", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:47.212294", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:frame\nexplanation:Based on the feedback that all the letters in the first guess were incorrect (red), I am changing all the letters in the first guess. \"frame\" is another common five-letter English word, and it doesn't share any letters with \"apple.\""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:47.212298", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "frame", "explanation": "Based on the feedback that all the letters in the first guess were incorrect (red), I am changing all the letters in the first guess. \"frame\" is another common five-letter English word, and it doesn't share any letters with \"apple.\""}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:47.212322", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = grout\nguess: frame\nguess_feedback: f<red> r<green> a<red> m<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "frame", "explanation": "Based on the feedback that all the letters in the first guess were incorrect (red), I am changing all the letters in the first guess. \"frame\" is another common five-letter English word, and it doesn't share any letters with \"apple.\"", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:49.519040", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> r<green> a<red> m<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T22:03:49.519070", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:fame\nexplanation:I am changing the first letter to \"f\" because it was the only letter that was incorrect in the previous guess. \"fame\" is another common five-letter English word, and it shares one correct letter (f) with the target word.
