You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:22:55.954613", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a fairly easily recognizable word with a variety of letters in it, reducing the chances of making an incorrect guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:22:55.954617", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a fairly easily recognizable word with a variety of letters in it, reducing the chances of making an incorrect guess."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:22:55.954654", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = share\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "share", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a fairly easily recognizable word with a variety of letters in it, reducing the chances of making an incorrect guess.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:22:58.962253", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:22:58.962308", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:eleph\nexplanation: Based on the feedback received after the first guess, the letter 'a' was incorrect and the letters 'p' were in the wrong position.
