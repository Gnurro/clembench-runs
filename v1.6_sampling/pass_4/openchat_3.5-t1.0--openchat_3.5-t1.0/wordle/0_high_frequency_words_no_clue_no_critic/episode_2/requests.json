You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word because it is a simple word and easy to remember.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:I am changing my guess to 'chart' because none of the letters in 'apple' matched the target word. 'Chart' is a valid English word and the first three letters 'cha' could potentially be correct in the target word. The first feedback indicated that all the letters were incorrect (red), so I chose 'chart' as it has no common letters with 'apple' and is a less common starting word.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: c<red> h<green> a<red> r<green> t<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:I am sticking with my guess 'chart' because the first three letters 'cha' are still correct in the target word. However, after the feedback, I realize 't' might be in the wrong position (yellow). I will keep 'chart' as my guess because it is a valid English word and it meets the word length requirement. I will also continue to consider words that start with 'chart' for my future guesses.\n<|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct User: guess_feedback: c<red> h<green> a<red> r<green> t<yellow><|end_of_turn|> GPT4 Correct Assistant: guess:chart\nexplanation:I am sticking with my guess 'chart' because the first three letters 'cha' are still correct in the target word.
