This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:10.431341", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:10.431345", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:10.431368", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = field\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "field", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:12.154161", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:12.154190", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: letter\nexplanation: The feedback for \"apple\" indicated that the letters 'a', 'p', and 'l' were incorrect, so I've chosen the word \"letter\", which contains the correct letter 'e' and has no green letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:12.154193", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "letter", "explanation": "The feedback for \"apple\" indicated that the letters 'a', 'p', and 'l' were incorrect, so I've chosen the word \"letter\", which contains the correct letter 'e' and has no green letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:12.154203", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: openchat_3.5) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "field", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "letter", "explanation": "The feedback for \"apple\" indicated that the letters 'a', 'p', and 'l' were incorrect, so I've chosen the word \"letter\", which contains the correct letter 'e' and has no green letters.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:24:14.133468", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
