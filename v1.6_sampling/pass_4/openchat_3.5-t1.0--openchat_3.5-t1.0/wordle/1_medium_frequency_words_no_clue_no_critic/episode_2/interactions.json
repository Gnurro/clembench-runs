You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:26:06.636840", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\n explanation: I chose this common English word with five letters because it has a mix of vowels and consonants, which should help me get some feedback to start narrowing down the possibilities."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:26:06.636844", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "I chose this common English word with five letters because it has a mix of vowels and consonants, which should help me get some feedback to start narrowing down the possibilities."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:26:06.636866", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = unlit\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unlit", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (openchat_3.5)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "I chose this common English word with five letters because it has a mix of vowels and consonants, which should help me get some feedback to start narrowing down the possibilities.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:26:09.698153", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-06T13:26:09.698184", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:eagle\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from my first guess, I know that the first letter 'a' is not in the target word, so I replaced it with 'e' which is another common vowel.
