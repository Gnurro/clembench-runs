Let's simplify:  \n\n> put sandwich in refrigerator  \nNext actions: Assume the refrigerator has a freezer section (even if unseen). Proceed to hallway to find the plate and mop next.  \n\n(If this fails, we’ll adjust. Goal progress: Sandwich handled for now.)  \n\n---  \n*Rationale: Some games abstract freezers as part of the fridge. If this doesn’t count, we’ll search for a standalone freezer later.*", "model_name": "deepseek-v3-0324"}}}]
