	 ANSWER: All hollow squares are uniformly ▢ with no other symbols.  \\ \tt \\ \tt Now ask a question to further compare the grids. Start with "QUESTION:" and do not add anything else.  \\ \tt QUESTION: Is the cell at position (4,4) a hollow square (▢), or does it contain an X? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
