	 ANSWER:  \\ \tt Yes, Row 1 and Row 3.  \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION:  \\ \tt In your grid, does the fifth column have an X in every row? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
