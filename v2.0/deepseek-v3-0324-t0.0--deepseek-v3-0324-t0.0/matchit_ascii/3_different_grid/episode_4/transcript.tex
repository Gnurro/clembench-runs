	 ANSWER: Yes, the second row is four empty squares followed by one X (▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X).  \\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: The third row ends with the three X's (no empty squares after).  \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: In the fourth and fifth rows of your grid, is the X always in the fifth position (▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X)? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
