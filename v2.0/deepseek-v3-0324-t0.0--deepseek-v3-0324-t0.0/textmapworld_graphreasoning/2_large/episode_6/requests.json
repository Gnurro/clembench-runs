Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.
