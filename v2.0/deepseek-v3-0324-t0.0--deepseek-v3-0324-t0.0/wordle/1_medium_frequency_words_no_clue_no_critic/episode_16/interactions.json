You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:32:53.647072", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. \"CRANE\" is not a valid word, so I'll use \"CRANE\" instead, which is a valid and commonly used starter in Wordle.  \nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:32:53.647325", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = tubal\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:32:53.647515", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:33:02.232947", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that only \"a\" is present but in the wrong position, and \"c\", \"r\", \"n\", \"e\" are absent.
