You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:33:39.539530", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and frequently used consonants to maximize information gain.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:33:39.539770", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = verve\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:33:39.539927", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:33:48.083003", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that \"e\" is correct and in the right position (5th letter). \"r\" is in the word but not in the 2nd position. \"c\", \"a\", and \"n\" are not in the word.
