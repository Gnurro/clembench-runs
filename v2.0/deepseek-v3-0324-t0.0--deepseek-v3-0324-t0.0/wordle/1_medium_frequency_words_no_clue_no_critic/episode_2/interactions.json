You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:27:01.946464", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and consonants to gather maximum information about the target word. \"CRANE\" is a good choice because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).  \nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:27:01.946733", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = loyal\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:27:01.946975", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:27:09.554490", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that \"a\" is in the word but not in the third position.
