You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:28:10.832228", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and consonants to gather maximum information about the target word. \"CRANE\" is a good choice because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).  \nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:28:10.832530", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = silly\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:28:10.832779", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:28:14.318452", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"crane\" were incorrect, I'll choose another common five-letter word with entirely different letters to maximize information. \"SLOTH\" includes new vowels (O) and consonants (S, L, T, H) not present in the previous guess.  \nguess: sloth"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:28:14.318935", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = silly\nguess = sloth\nguess_feedback = s<green> l<yellow> o<red> t<red> h<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:28:14.319112", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<green> l<yellow> o<red> t<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:28:17.736067", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: \"S\" is correct and in the first position. \"L\" is present but not in the second position. \"O\", \"T\", and \"H\" are absent.
