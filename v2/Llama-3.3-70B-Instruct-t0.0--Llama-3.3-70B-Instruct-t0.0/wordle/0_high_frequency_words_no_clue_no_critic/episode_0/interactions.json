You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:50:11.434553", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:50:11.435051", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = press\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<green> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:50:11.435159", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<green> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:50:20.454876", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"s\" is in the correct position and \"e\" is in the word but not in the correct position, while \"h\", \"o\", and \"u\" are not in the word.
