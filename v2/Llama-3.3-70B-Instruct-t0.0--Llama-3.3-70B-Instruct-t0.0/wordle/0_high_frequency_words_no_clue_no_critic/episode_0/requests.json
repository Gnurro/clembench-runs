Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<green> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"s\" is in the correct position and \"e\" is in the word but not in the correct position, while \"h\", \"o\", and \"u\" are not in the word. My next guess will utilize this information by keeping \"s\" in the same position and trying \"e\" in a different spot, and introducing new letters.\nguess: space<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> p<yellow> a<red> c<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"s\" and \"e\" are in the word but not in the correct positions, and \"p\" is also in the word but not correctly placed, while \"a\" and \"c\" are not in the word. My next guess will try to utilize the correct positions of \"s\", \"p\", and \"e\" by rearranging them and introducing new letters to fill in the gaps.\nguess: speck<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> p<yellow> e<green> c<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"e\" is now in the correct position, and \"s\" and \"p\" are still in the word but not in the correct positions, while \"c\" and \"k\" are not in the word. My next guess will build on this by keeping \"e\" in the same position, trying to find the correct positions for \"s\" and \"p\", and introducing new letters to replace \"c\" and \"k\".\nguess: steep<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> t<red> e<green> e<red> p<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"e\" is still in the correct position, \"s\" and \"p\" are in the word but not in the correct positions, and the second \"e\" is not in the word, while \"t\" is not in the word.
