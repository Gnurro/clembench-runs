My next guess will focus on rearranging \"h\" and \"e\" and introducing new letters.\nguess: heaps<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> e<yellow> a<yellow> p<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"h\", \"e\", \"a\", and \"p\" are all present in the word but not in the correct positions, while \"s\" is not in the word. This gives a strong set of letters to work with.
