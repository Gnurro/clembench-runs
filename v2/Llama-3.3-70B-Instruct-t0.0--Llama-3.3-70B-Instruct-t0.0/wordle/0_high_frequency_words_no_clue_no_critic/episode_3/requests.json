My next guess will try to utilize the correct letters in different positions and introduce new vowels and consonants.\nguess: harsh<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> a<yellow> r<red> s<yellow> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"h\", \"a\", and \"s\" are in the word but not in the correct positions, and \"r\" is not in the word. Since \"h\" appeared twice in the guess but only one \"h\" is yellow, it suggests the word might contain \"h\" only once. My next guess will try to utilize \"h\", \"a\", and \"s\" in different combinations.\nguess: haste<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> a<yellow> s<yellow> t<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback confirms that \"h\", \"a\", and \"s\" are in the word, but their positions are incorrect, and \"t\" and \"e\" are not in the word.
