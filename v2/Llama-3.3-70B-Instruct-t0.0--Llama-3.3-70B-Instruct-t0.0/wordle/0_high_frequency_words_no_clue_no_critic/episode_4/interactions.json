You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:29.128996", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:29.129326", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = after\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:29.129421", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:35.662597", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that all letters except \"e\" are incorrect, and \"e\" is in the wrong position, so my next guess will be a word that includes \"e\" in a different position and introduces new letters that are commonly used in English words.\nguess: fence"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:35.662914", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = after\nguess = fence\nguess_feedback = f<yellow> e<yellow> n<red> c<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:35.663002", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<yellow> e<yellow> n<red> c<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:43.979728", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that \"f\" and the first \"e\" are in the word but not in the correct position, and the other letters are incorrect, so my next guess will be a word that includes \"f\" and \"e\" in different positions and introduces new letters that are commonly paired with \"f\" and \"e\".\nguess: fever"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:43.980049", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = after\nguess = fever\nguess_feedback = f<yellow> e<red> v<red> e<green> r<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:43.980140", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<yellow> e<red> v<red> e<green> r<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:55.227558", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"f\" is in the word but not in the correct position, \"e\" is now in the correct position at the end, and \"r\" is also in the correct position at the end, so my next guess will be a word that keeps the correct positions of \"e\" and \"r\", and tries to utilize \"f\" in a different position, while introducing a new letter that is commonly used in English words.\nguess: ferie"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:55.228027", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:52:55.228076", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
