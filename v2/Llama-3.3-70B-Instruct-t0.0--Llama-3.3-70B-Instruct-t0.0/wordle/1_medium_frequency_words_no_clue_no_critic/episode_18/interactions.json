This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:19.971226", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:19.971545", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = reedy\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:19.971635", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:26.532602", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that all letters except \"e\" are incorrect, and \"e\" is in the wrong position, so my next guess will be a word that includes \"e\" in a different position and introduces new letters that are commonly used in English words.\nguess: fence"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:26.532904", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = reedy\nguess = fence\nguess_feedback = f<red> e<green> n<red> c<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:26.532993", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> e<green> n<red> c<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:34.013470", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that \"e\" is now in the correct position, and the second \"e\" is in the wrong position, so my next guess will focus on keeping the correctly positioned \"e\" and adjusting the other letters, including the second \"e\", to find a valid word.\nguess: geeze"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:34.014063", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:20:34.014113", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
