You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:13.591910", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:13.592244", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = biddy\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:13.592341", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:20.126472", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:20.126761", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = biddy\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<green> r<red> e<red> a<red> d<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:20.126849", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<green> r<red> e<red> a<red> d<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:28.010610", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With \"b\" being correct and in the right position, and \"d\" being correct but in the wrong position, my next guess will build upon this information, keeping \"b\" as the first letter and trying to utilize \"d\" in a different position, while introducing new letters to fill in the gaps.\nguess: blind"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:28.010894", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = biddy\nguess = blind\nguess_feedback = b<green> l<red> i<yellow> n<red> d<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:28.010998", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<green> l<red> i<yellow> n<red> d<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:37.820476", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"b\" remains in the correct position, \"d\" is still in the mix but not in the right spot, and \"i\" has been introduced as a correct but misplaced letter, my next guess will aim to capitalize on this, adjusting the positions of \"d\" and \"i\" while keeping \"b\" at the start, and introducing new letters to replace the incorrect ones.\nguess: bitch"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:37.821077", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T18:58:37.821127", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
