You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:02.865287", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:02.865609", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:02.865712", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:09.396889", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:09.397175", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<red> e<red> a<red> d<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:09.397262", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<red> d<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:17.062296", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With the letter \"d\" being the only correct letter and it being in the correct position, my next guess will focus on keeping \"d\" as the last letter and trying out a new combination of letters that are commonly used in many English words, hoping to get at least one more letter correct.\nguess: handi"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:17.062891", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T19:01:17.062941", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
