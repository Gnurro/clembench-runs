You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:11:59.209674", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:11:59.210069", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = gland\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:11:59.210167", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:05.772102", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:05.772403", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = gland\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:05.772495", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:12.702967", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With \"a\" being yellow and \"d\" being green, my next guess will try to utilize this information by keeping \"d\" at the end and placing \"a\" in different positions to find the correct spot, while introducing new letters to fill in the blanks.\nguess: laden"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:12.703319", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = gland\nguess = laden\nguess_feedback = l<yellow> a<yellow> d<yellow> e<red> n<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:12.703410", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<yellow> a<yellow> d<yellow> e<red> n<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:22.099568", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"l\", \"a\", \"d\", and \"n\" are all yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct position, and considering \"d\" was previously green at the end, my next guess will try to utilize the fact that \"d\" might be at the end again, and rearrange the other letters to find a valid word.\nguess: lands"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:22.099918", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 4\ntarget_word = gland\nguess = lands\nguess_feedback = l<yellow> a<yellow> n<yellow> d<yellow> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:22.100020", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<yellow> a<yellow> n<yellow> d<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:31.453111", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With \"l\", \"a\", \"n\", and \"d\" still yellow, and knowing \"d\" was previously correct at the end, my next guess will keep \"d\" at the end and try a different arrangement of \"l\", \"a\", and \"n\" to find the correct order, while replacing \"s\" with a new letter.\nguess: landa"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:31.453599", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:12:31.453648", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
