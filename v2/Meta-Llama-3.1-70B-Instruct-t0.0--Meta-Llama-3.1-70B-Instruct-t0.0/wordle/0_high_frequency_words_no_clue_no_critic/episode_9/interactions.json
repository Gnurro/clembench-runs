You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:38:06.598407", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one or two correct letters.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:38:06.598761", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = could\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<green> u<green> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:38:06.598855", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<green> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:38:13.481069", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters \"o\" and \"u\" are present in the target word, so I'll keep them in the next guess.
