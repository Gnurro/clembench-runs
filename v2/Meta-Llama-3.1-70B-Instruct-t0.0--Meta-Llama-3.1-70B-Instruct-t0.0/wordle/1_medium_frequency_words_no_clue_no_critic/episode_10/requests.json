This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one or two correct letters.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since all the letters in the previous guess were incorrect, I'll try a new word with a different set of letters, focusing on common English words with a good balance of vowels and consonants.\nguess: bread<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<red> d<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The letter \"d\" was marked as yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, so I'll keep it and try to surround it with new letters that are commonly paired with \"d\" in English words.\nguess: draft<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: d<green> r<red> a<red> f<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The letter \"d\" is now in the correct position, so I'll keep it as the first letter and try to find a new combination of letters that fit the remaining positions, focusing on common English words that start with \"d\".\nguess: dodge<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: d<green> o<red> d<red> g<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The letter \"d\" is still in the correct position, and I'll try to find a new combination of letters that fit the remaining positions, focusing on common English words that start with \"d\" and have a different set of letters than the previous guesses.\nguess: ditch<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-21 20:45:33.509288", "call_duration": "0:00:06.977057", "response": "explanation: The letter \"d\" is still in the correct position, and I'll try to find a new combination of letters that fit the remaining positions, focusing on common English words that start with \"d\" and have a different set of letters than the previous guesses.\nguess: ditch", "model_name": "Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:45:46.980023", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
