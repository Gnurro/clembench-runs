You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:38.808259", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one or two correct letters.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:38.808626", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = mania\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:38.808718", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:43.955608", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all the letters in the previous guess were incorrect, I'll try a new word with a different set of letters, focusing on common English words with a good balance of vowels and consonants.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:43.955910", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = mania\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:43.956004", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:51.088262", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"a\" was marked as yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, so I'll keep \"a\" and try to surround it with new letters, choosing a word that is common and has a good chance of getting more correct letters.\nguess: stamp"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:51.088703", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = mania\nguess = stamp\nguess_feedback = s<red> t<red> a<yellow> m<yellow> p<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:51.088797", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<yellow> m<yellow> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:58.264555", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Both \"a\" and \"m\" were marked as yellow, indicating they're in the word but not in the correct position, so I'll keep these letters and try to find a word that fits, choosing a new set of surrounding letters that are common in English words.\nguess: claim"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:58.264868", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 4\ntarget_word = mania\nguess = claim\nguess_feedback = c<red> l<red> a<yellow> i<green> m<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:46:58.264961", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> l<red> a<yellow> i<green> m<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:47:07.024163", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"i\" was marked as green, indicating it's in the correct position, and both \"a\" and \"m\" are still yellow, so I'll keep these letters and try to find a word that fits, focusing on words that end with the \"im\" pattern and have \"i\" in the correct position.\nguess: whimy"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:47:07.024650", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T20:47:07.024701", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
