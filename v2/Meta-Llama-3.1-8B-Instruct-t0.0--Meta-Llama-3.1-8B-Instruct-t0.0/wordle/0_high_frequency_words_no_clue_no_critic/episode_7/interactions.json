You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:28:15.758555", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that is often used in everyday conversations.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:28:15.758835", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = those\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<yellow> o<yellow> u<red> s<green> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:28:15.758921", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<yellow> o<yellow> u<red> s<green> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:28:18.691273", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since 'h', 'o', and's' are in the correct word, and 'e' is also present, I will focus on the letters that are not in the correct position, which are 'h' and 'o'.
