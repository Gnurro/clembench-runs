You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:29:41.189452", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that is often used in everyday conversations.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:29:41.189741", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:29:41.189827", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:29:43.109590", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all the letters in my previous guess were marked as red, it means none of them appear in the target word.
