You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:46:22.763891", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and consonants.\nguess: audio"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:46:22.764150", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = audio\nguess_feedback = a<red> u<red> d<red> i<green> o<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:46:22.764243", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> u<red> d<red> i<green> o<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:46:25.572721", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"i\" is in the correct position.
