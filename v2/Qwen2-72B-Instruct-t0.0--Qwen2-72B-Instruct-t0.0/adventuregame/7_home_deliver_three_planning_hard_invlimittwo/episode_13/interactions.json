If the table is not found in the kitchen, I'll search the hallway and living room. Once the table is located, place the potted plant on it. After that, focus on finding the book and the mop, prioritizing the living room and other nearby areas. Make sure to thoroughly inspect all possible locations for these items. If there's any uncertainty about the actions, ask for clarification"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-08T08:29:57.655122", "action": {"type": "action_fail", "content": {"phase": "parsing", "fail_type": "undefined_action_verb", "arg": "search", "exploration_info": {"action_epistemic": false, "action_pragmatic": false, "effective_epistemic_gain_amount": 0, "known_entities": [["at", "player1", "kitchen1"], ["at", "orange1", "pantry1"], ["at", "counter1", "kitchen1"], ["at", "sandwich1", "pantry1"], ["at", "freezer1", "pantry1"], ["at", "banana1", "pantry1"], ["at", "refrigerator1", "pantry1"], ["at", "peach1", "pantry1"], ["at", "pottedplant1", "kitchen1"], ["at", "apple1", "pantry1"], ["at", "plate1", "kitchen1"], ["at", "cupboard1", "kitchen1"]], "known_entities_ratio": 0.41379310344827586, "visited_rooms": ["hallway1", "pantry1", "kitchen1"], "visited_rooms_ratio": 0.5, "known_goal_entities": [["at", "refrigerator1", "pantry1"], ["at", "pottedplant1", "kitchen1"]], "known_goal_entities_ratio": 0.3333333333333333}}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-08T08:29:57.655223", "action": {"type": "goal_status", "content": {"goal_states_achieved": [], "turn_goal_score": 0}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-08T08:29:57.655269", "action": {"type": "turn_limit_reached", "content": 50}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-08T08:29:57.655309", "action": {"type": "game_result", "content": {"goal_states_achieved": [], "game_successfully_finished": false}}}]], "adventure_info": {"variant": "planning_inventory_limit_two", "max_turns": 50, "optimal_turns": 21, "goal_count": 3}}
