You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:06.773902", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common word that contains a variety of letters to get initial feedback.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:06.774193", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = cheap\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<green> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:06.774282", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<green> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:11.353373", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The 'c' is in the correct spot, while 'a' and 'e' need to be relocated based on yellow feedback; avoiding previously marked red letters.\nguess: cease"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:11.353659", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = cheap\nguess = cease\nguess_feedback = c<green> e<yellow> a<yellow> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:11.353748", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<green> e<yellow> a<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:16.048251", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Keeping 'c' in place, moving 'e' and 'a' to different positions, and trying new letters to replace 's' and 'e'.\nguess: cavea"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:16.048737", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Qwen2-72B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:31:16.048786", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
