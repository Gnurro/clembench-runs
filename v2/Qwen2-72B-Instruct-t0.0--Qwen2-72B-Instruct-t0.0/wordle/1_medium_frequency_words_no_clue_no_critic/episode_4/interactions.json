You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:39:27.690011", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common word that contains a variety of letters to get initial feedback.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:39:27.690311", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = prize\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<green> a<red> n<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:39:27.690401", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<green> a<red> n<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:39:33.478964", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters 'r' and 'e' are in the word, and since 'c', 'a', and 'n' are not, I'll focus on replacing those with common letters that could fit the pattern.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:39:33.479353", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = prize\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<green> e<yellow> a<red> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:39:33.479445", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<green> e<yellow> a<red> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T21:39:38.624344", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: 'r' is in the right spot, 'e' is in the word but misplaced.
