	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: byrd book\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue mentions 'byrd' which could be related to the word 'bird'. Also, it mentions 'book', so I'm thinking of a word that could relate to a bird and is found in literature. A common bird in literature is the 'raven', famously featured in Edgar Allan Poe's poem.\\ \tt guess: raven

	 explanation: From the feedback, we know that 'r' and 'n' are not in the word, but 'a', 'e', and 'n' are in the wrong positions. The clue still points towards a bird-related term. Considering the letters that are yellow, a possible word could be 'neat', but since the clue is about a bird, 'eagle' comes to mind as it contains the yellow letters and is a type of bird.\\ \tt guess: eagle

	 explanation: The feedback shows that 'e' and 'g' are incorrect, while 'a' and 'l' are in the wrong positions, and 'e' is in the correct position at the end. Keeping the bird theme from the clue, and considering the yellow letters, 'aleve' could fit, but it's not a standard English word. Instead, focusing on the correct 'e' at the end and the yellow 'a' and 'l', the word 'l
