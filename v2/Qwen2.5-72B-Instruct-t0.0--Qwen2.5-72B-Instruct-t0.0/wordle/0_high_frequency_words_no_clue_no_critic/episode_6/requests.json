You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Starting with a common word that has a mix of vowels and consonants to get some initial feedback.\nguess: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<green> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'n' is in the correct position.
