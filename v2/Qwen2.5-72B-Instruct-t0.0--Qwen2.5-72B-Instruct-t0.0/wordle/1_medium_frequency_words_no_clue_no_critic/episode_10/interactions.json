You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:11:24.944145", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common word that has a mix of vowels and consonants to get some initial feedback.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:11:24.944468", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = dizzy\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:11:24.944560", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:11:29.869791", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"crane\" were incorrect, I will try a different set of letters. \"lions\" contains a mix of vowels and consonants not previously tried.\nguess: lions"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:11:29.870178", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = dizzy\nguess = lions\nguess_feedback = l<red> i<green> o<red> n<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:11:29.870271", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<red> i<green> o<red> n<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:11:34.138860", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter 'i' is in the correct position.
