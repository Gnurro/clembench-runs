You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:04.487949", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common word that has a mix of vowels and consonants to get some initial feedback.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:04.488261", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:04.488366", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:09.389894", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"crane\" were incorrect, I will try a different set of letters. \"lions\" contains a mix of vowels and consonants not previously tried.\nguess: lions"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:09.390284", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = lions\nguess_feedback = l<green> i<green> o<red> n<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:09.390378", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<green> i<green> o<red> n<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:13.528697", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With 'l' and 'i' confirmed in their positions, I will keep them fixed and try different letters for the remaining positions.\nguess: linty"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:13.529046", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = linty\nguess_feedback = l<green> i<green> n<red> t<red> y<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:13.529139", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<green> i<green> n<red> t<red> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:19.690010", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Keeping 'l' and 'i' in their correct positions, and knowing 'n', 't', and 'y' are not part of the word, I will try 'listo' to test new letters.\nguess: listo"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:19.690634", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T20:01:19.690686", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
