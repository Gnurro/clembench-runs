This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:48:13.346466", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:48:13.346736", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = alone\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<green> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:48:13.346836", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<green> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-24T17:48:18.081222", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that 'a' and 'e' are correct and in their respective positions, while 'p' is incorrect, and 'l' is correct but in the wrong position.
