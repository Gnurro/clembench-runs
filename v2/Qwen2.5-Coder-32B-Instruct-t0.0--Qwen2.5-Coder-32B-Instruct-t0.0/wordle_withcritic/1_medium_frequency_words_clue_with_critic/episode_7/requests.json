You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: kind of back or hair\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: The clue suggests a word that could relate to the back or hair. Considering common five-letter words associated with these concepts, \"scalp\" comes to mind.\nguess: scalp<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nclue: kind of back or hair\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the clue suggests a word that could relate to the back or hair, and \"scalp\" fits both criteria.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Given the agreement and the clue, \"scalp\" seems like a strong candidate. Let's proceed with this guess.\nguess: scalp<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<red> c<yellow> a<yellow> l<yellow> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Based on the feedback, 's' and 'p' are incorrect, while 'c', 'a', and 'l' are present in the word but in different positions. A possible rearrangement could be \"calca,\" but since \"calca\" is not a valid English word, let's try another permutation like \"lacta.\"\nguess: lacta<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Given that \"lacta\" is not a valid word, and considering the feedback where 'c', 'a', and 'l' are present but in different positions, let's try \"calca\" again but ensure it forms a valid word. Another possibility could be \"clack.\"\nguess: clack<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nclue: kind of back or hair\nguess_agreement: no\nagreement_explanation: the clue suggests a word related to the back or hair, and \"clack\" does not fit either category. Additionally, there is no indication from previous feedback that 'k' is part of the word.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Given the feedback and the clue, we know 's' and 'p' are incorrect, and 'c', 'a', and 'l' are present but in different positions. Since \"clack\" was not agreed upon, let's try another permutation of 'c', 'a', and 'l' that forms a valid word related to the back or hair. A good candidate could be \"latch.\"\nguess: latch<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> a<green> t<red> c<yellow> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Based on the feedback, 't' and 'h' are incorrect, while 'l' and 'a' are present but in different positions, and 'c' is present but in the wrong position. Given this information, a possible word could be \"calca,\" but since it's not valid, let's try \"alcay.\"\nguess: alcay<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Given the feedback, 't' and 'h' are incorrect, while 'l' and 'a' are present but in different positions, and 'c' is present but in the wrong position.
