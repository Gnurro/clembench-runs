You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T19:29:03.874215", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T19:29:03.874588", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = cheap\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<yellow> p<yellow> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T19:29:03.874690", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T19:29:06.821470", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that 'a' and 'p' are present in the word but in the wrong positions, while 'l' and 'e' are not in the word.
