You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:26:18.208773", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common, balanced set of vowels and consonants to gather initial information.\nguess: audio"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:26:18.209049", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = intro\nguess = audio\nguess_feedback = a<red> u<red> d<red> i<yellow> o<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:26:18.209141", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> u<red> d<red> i<yellow> o<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:26:21.170152", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since 'o' is in the correct spot and 'i' is in the word but in the wrong position, I'll keep 'o' and 'i' and replace the other letters with new ones to cover more possible options.\nguess: boilt"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:26:21.170818", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: aya-expanse-32b) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T22:26:21.170868", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
