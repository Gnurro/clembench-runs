You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:09:00.103652", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that contains frequently used vowels and consonants.\nguess: stare"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:09:00.104471", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = least\nguess = stare\nguess_feedback = s<yellow> t<yellow> a<green> r<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:09:00.104708", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<yellow> t<yellow> a<green> r<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:09:03.171942", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: From the feedback, 'a' is in position 3, 's' and 't' are in the word but in wrong positions, and 'e' is in the word but not at the end.
