This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:18:45.422399", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common word that contains frequently used vowels and consonants.\nguess: stare"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:18:45.422980", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = drape\nguess = stare\nguess_feedback = s<red> t<red> a<green> r<yellow> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:18:45.423134", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<green> r<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:18:47.702056", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: From the feedback, 'a' and 'e' are in correct positions (1st and 5th), and 'r' exists but in wrong position.
