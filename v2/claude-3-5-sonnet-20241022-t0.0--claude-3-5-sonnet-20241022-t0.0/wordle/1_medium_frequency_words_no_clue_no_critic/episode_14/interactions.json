You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:32.710242", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that contains frequently used vowels and consonants.\nguess: stare"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:32.711183", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = phony\nguess = stare\nguess_feedback = s<red> t<red> a<red> r<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:32.711456", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<red> r<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:34.528167", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in 'stare' were incorrect, I'll try a completely different set of letters, focusing on remaining common letters.\nguess: cloud"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:34.528848", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = phony\nguess = cloud\nguess_feedback = c<red> l<red> o<green> u<red> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:34.529079", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> l<red> o<green> u<red> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:36.264889", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: We know 'o' is in the correct position (3rd letter).
