You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:44.498113", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that contains frequently used vowels and consonants.\nguess: stare"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:44.499231", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = adorn\nguess = stare\nguess_feedback = s<red> t<red> a<yellow> r<green> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:44.499535", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<yellow> r<green> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:12:46.614310", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows 'r' is in the correct position (4th), 'a' exists but in wrong position, and 's', 't', 'e' are not in the word.
