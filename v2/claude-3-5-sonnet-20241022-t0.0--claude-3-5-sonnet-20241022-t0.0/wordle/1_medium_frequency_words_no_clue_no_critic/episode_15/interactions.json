You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:19:29.538260", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common word that contains frequently used vowels and consonants.\nguess: stare"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:19:29.538827", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = inbox\nguess = stare\nguess_feedback = s<red> t<red> a<red> r<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:19:29.538977", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<red> r<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:19:30.977073", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in 'stare' were incorrect, I'll try a completely different set of letters, focusing on remaining common consonants and vowels.\nguess: pound"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:19:30.977613", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = inbox\nguess = pound\nguess_feedback = p<red> o<yellow> u<red> n<yellow> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:19:30.977764", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: p<red> o<yellow> u<red> n<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:19:33.612447", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: We know 'o' and 'n' are in the word but in different positions.
