You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:41:04.425413", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to gather initial feedback on the presence and position of letters.  \nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:41:04.425851", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = cheap\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<green> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:41:04.426011", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<green> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:41:07.412047", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that 'c' is in the correct position (green), 'a' and 'e' are in the word but in the wrong positions (yellow), and 'r' and 'n' are not in the word (red).
