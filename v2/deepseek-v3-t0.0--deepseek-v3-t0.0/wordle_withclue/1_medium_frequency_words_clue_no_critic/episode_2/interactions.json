This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: beauty aid\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T16:40:17.787189", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: A common beauty aid that is often used and has five letters is \"cream,\" which is a basic skincare product.\nguess: cream"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T16:40:17.787686", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = rouge\ntarget_word_clue = beauty aid\nguess = cream\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> m<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T16:40:17.787846", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> m<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T16:40:19.558529", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"r\" and \"e\" are in the word but not in their current positions, while \"c,\" \"a,\" and \"m\" are not in the word.
