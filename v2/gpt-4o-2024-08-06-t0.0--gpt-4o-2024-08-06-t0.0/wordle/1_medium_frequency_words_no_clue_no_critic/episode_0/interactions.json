You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:13:16.207644", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:13:16.208001", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = tutor\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:13:16.208158", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:13:17.067471", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: none of the letters in \"apple\" are in the target word, so I will choose a word with completely different letters.\nguess: brick"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:13:17.067853", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = tutor\nguess = brick\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<yellow> i<red> c<red> k<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:13:17.068009", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> i<red> c<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:13:18.297729", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: \"r\" is in the word but not in the second position.
