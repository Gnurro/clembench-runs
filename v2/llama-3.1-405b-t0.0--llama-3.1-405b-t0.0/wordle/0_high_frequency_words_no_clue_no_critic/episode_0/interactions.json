You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:13:51.951791", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:13:51.953065", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = press\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<green> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:13:51.953401", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<green> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:13:54.870404", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"s\" is in the correct position and \"e\" is in the word but not in the correct position, I'll look for a word that includes \"s\" and \"e\" and also try to utilize common word patterns by introducing new letters to increase the chances of correct guesses.\nguess: siege"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:13:54.871968", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = press\nguess = siege\nguess_feedback = s<yellow> i<red> e<green> g<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:13:54.872182", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<yellow> i<red> e<green> g<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:13:58.730034", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The previous feedback indicates that \"e\" was initially in the wrong position but is now correct, suggesting the first \"e\" might be the correct position for \"e\" after all, and the guess also revealed \"s\" moved to an incorrect position;
