You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:20:31.804761", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start by guessing a common five-letter word in English, which also helps in getting more letters for feedback. \nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:20:31.805707", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = think\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:20:31.805899", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:20:36.162797", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"h\" is marked as yellow, it means the target word contains \"h\" but not in the first position.
