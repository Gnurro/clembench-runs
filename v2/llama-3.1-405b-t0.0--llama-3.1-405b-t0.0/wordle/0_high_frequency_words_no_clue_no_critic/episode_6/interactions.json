You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:00.973213", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:00.974367", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = least\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<green> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:00.974675", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<green> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:04.140696", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"s\" is correct and in the right position, and \"e\" is correct but in the wrong position, my next guess will include these letters, trying to find a new combination with \"e\" in a different position, and replacing the incorrect letters \"h\", \"o\", and \"u\" with new ones.\nguess: seeps"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:04.142117", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = least\nguess = seeps\nguess_feedback = s<yellow> e<green> e<red> p<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:04.142448", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<yellow> e<green> e<red> p<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:10.176876", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The correct letter \"s\" is now in the wrong position, and \"e\" is correct and in the right position, but there's an extra \"e\" which is incorrect.
