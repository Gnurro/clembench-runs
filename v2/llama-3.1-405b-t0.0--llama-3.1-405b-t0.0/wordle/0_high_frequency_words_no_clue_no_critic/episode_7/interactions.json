This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:23.823302", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:23.824397", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = those\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<yellow> o<yellow> u<red> s<green> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:23.824732", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<yellow> o<yellow> u<red> s<green> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:16:27.288455", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback, the letters \"s\" and \"e\" are in the correct position.
