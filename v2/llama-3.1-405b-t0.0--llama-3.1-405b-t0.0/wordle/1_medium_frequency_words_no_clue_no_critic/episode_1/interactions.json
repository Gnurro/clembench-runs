You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:42.246274", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with a common five-letter English word, often used as a beginning word in Wordle games because it has a good balance of vowels and consonants.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:42.247186", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = koala\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:42.247417", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:46.342220", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"o\" is the only correct letter in the right or wrong position, I will try to build on it by choosing a common word that contains \"o\" and excludes the incorrect letters \"h\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\".\nguess:koliv was changed to broth is not a great fit based on feedback, however the word \"brook\" includes the letter O however \"k\" could be elsewhere or not at all, مشتر I changed it to cocoa – seems"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:46.343017", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guess does not conform to the format rules\nError: The guess should be a single word and should only contain letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:46.343243", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "game_result = ABORT"}}]], "n_turns": 6, "Played turns": 2, "Complete turns": 1, "Aborted": true, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [1, 1], "Parsed Request Count": [1, 0], "Violated Request Count": [0, 1], "Evaluation": {"target_word": "koala", "target_word_clue": "zoo critter", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "use_clue": false, "use_critic": false, "guess": [["house", "h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>"]], "guess_explanation": ["I am starting with a common five-letter English word, often used as a beginning word in Wordle games because it has a good balance of vowels and consonants."], "critic_feedback": {}}}
