You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:26:55.740076", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with a commonly used five-letter English word, often a good first guess in Wordle games.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:26:55.740567", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:26:55.740727", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:05.233364", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"house\" are marked as red, my next guess will be a completely different set of letters, trying to cover more of the alphabet and increasing the chances of getting at least one correct letter.\nguess: brink"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:05.233810", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = brink\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<red> i<yellow> n<yellow> k<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:05.233973", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> i<yellow> n<yellow> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:07.633347", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters \"i\" and \"n\" are marked as yellow, indicating they are present in the word but not in the correct position, so my next guess will try to utilize these letters in different positions, and also introduce new letters to gain more information.\nguess: tinny"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:07.633989", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = tinny\nguess_feedback = t<red> i<yellow> n<green> n<red> y<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:07.634148", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> i<yellow> n<green> n<red> y<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:10.800024", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"n\" is now marked as green, indicating it is in the correct position, and \"i\" and \"y\" are still marked as yellow, so my next guess will try to keep \"n\" in the same position, and also utilize the letters \"i\" and \"y\" in different positions, with the goal of finding the correct placement for them.\nguess: windy"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:10.800750", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 4\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = windy\nguess_feedback = w<red> i<yellow> n<green> d<red> y<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:10.800909", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: w<red> i<yellow> n<green> d<red> y<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:14.723373", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"n\" is still marked as green, and \"i\" and \"y\" remain yellow, so my next guess will continue to keep \"n\" in the same position, try to find the correct placement for \"i\" and \"y\", and also replace the letters \"w\" and \"d\" since they are marked as red, introducing new letters to increase the chances of getting the word correct.\nguess: linyx"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:14.724138", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: llama-3.1-405b) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:27:14.724228", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
