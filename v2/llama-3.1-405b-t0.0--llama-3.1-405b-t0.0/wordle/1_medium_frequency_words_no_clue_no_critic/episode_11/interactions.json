You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:30:50.410036", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:30:50.410488", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = drape\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:30:50.410654", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:30:53.175545", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters except \"e\" are marked as incorrect, my next guess will focus on utilizing the correct letter \"e\" and introducing new letters that are commonly paired with \"e\" in English words.\nguess: theme"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:30:53.176156", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = drape\nguess = theme\nguess_feedback = t<red> h<red> e<red> m<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:30:53.176343", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> h<red> e<red> m<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:30:55.499465", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Although the last \"e\" is still correct, the first \"e\" is now marked as incorrect.
