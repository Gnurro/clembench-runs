You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:09.805449", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, which might give me the most information from the feedback.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:09.805898", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = peril\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:09.806053", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:12.064879", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all the letters except \"e\" are marked red, my next guess will include \"e\" and introduce new letters that are commonly used in English words, while avoiding the letters \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\".\nguess: fleet"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:12.065331", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = peril\nguess = fleet\nguess_feedback = f<red> l<yellow> e<yellow> e<red> t<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:12.065485", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> l<yellow> e<yellow> e<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:15.285550", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This feedback suggests that \"e\" (in one position) and \"l\" are potential letters, while \"f\", \"e\" (in the other position), and \"t\" are not.
