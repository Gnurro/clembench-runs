You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:26.927265", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a commonly used five-letter word in the English language to test the waters and understand the pattern of the target word.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:26.927722", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = kappa\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:26.927877", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:29.543949", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all the letters in the previous guess were incorrect, I'll try a new set of letters with a different commonly used five-letter word to increase the chances of getting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:29.544353", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = kappa\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:29.544512", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:32:34.789862", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"a\" in the previous guess was marked as yellow, indicating it's present in the target word but not in the correct position.
