This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:22:48.222289", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start with a commonly used five-letter English word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, making it a suitable starting point for this guessing game.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:22:48.223425", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = alone\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:22:48.223744", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:22:53.200779", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"e\" is in the correct position and \"o\" appears in the word but not in the correct position, my next guess will include these letters and exclude \"h\", \"u\", and \"s\".
