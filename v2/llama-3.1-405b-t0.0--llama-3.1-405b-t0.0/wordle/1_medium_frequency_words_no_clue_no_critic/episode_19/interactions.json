You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:05.936439", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:05.937554", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = pesky\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:05.937894", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:08.907514", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: since \"h\", \"o\", and \"u\" are marked as red, I will exclude them from the next guess, and as \"s\" and \"e\" are yellow, I will try to utilize them in a different position, looking for a word that commonly has \"s\" and \"e\" in it.\nguess: siege"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:08.908958", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = pesky\nguess = siege\nguess_feedback = s<yellow> i<red> e<yellow> g<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:08.909300", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<yellow> i<red> e<yellow> g<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:12.220641", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: with \"i\", \"g\", and the second \"e\" marked as red, I will exclude them from the next guess, and since \"s\" and the first \"e\" are still yellow, I will try to find a word that has them in a different position, possibly with \"s\" at the end, as it's a common suffix.\nguess: tense"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:12.221997", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = pesky\nguess = tense\nguess_feedback = t<red> e<green> n<red> s<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:12.222322", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> e<green> n<red> s<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:17.819997", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: since \"t\", \"n\", and the second \"e\" are marked as red, I will exclude them from the next guess, and with the first \"e\" marked as green, I will keep it in the same position, and as \"s\" is still yellow, I will try to find a word that has it in a different position, looking for a word that starts with a vowel or a common consonant and has \"e\" as its second letter.\nguess:"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:17.820911", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guess does not conform to the format rules\nError: The response should contain the 'guess:' keyword only once."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:23:17.821179", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "game_result = ABORT"}}]], "n_turns": 6, "Played turns": 4, "Complete turns": 3, "Aborted": true, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [1, 1, 1, 1], "Parsed Request Count": [1, 1, 1, 0], "Violated Request Count": [0, 0, 0, 1], "Evaluation": {"target_word": "pesky", "target_word_clue": "vexatious", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "use_clue": false, "use_critic": false, "guess": [["house", "h<red> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<yellow>"], ["siege", "s<yellow> i<red> e<yellow> g<red> e<red>"], ["tense", "t<red> e<green> n<red> s<yellow> e<red>"]], "guess_explanation": ["this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "since \"h\", \"o\", and \"u\" are marked as red, I will exclude them from the next guess, and as \"s\" and \"e\" are yellow, I will try to utilize them in a different position, looking for a word that commonly has \"s\" and \"e\" in it.", "with \"i\", \"g\", and the second \"e\" marked as red, I will exclude them from the next guess, and since \"s\" and the first \"e\" are still yellow, I will try to find a word that has them in a different position, possibly with \"s\" at the end, as it's a common suffix."], "critic_feedback": {}}}
