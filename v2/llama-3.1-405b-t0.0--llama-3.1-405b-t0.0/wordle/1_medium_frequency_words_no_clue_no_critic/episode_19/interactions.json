You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:33:55.539496", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:33:55.539973", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = racer\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:33:55.540131", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:34:02.151664", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters except \"e\" are marked as incorrect, my next guess will be a new five-letter word that includes \"e\" in a different position and excludes the letters \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\".\nguess: fleet"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:34:02.152129", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = racer\nguess = fleet\nguess_feedback = f<red> l<red> e<red> e<green> t<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:34:02.152287", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> l<red> e<red> e<green> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:34:05.126579", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that the correct word contains the letter \"e\" twice, but not consecutively, and the second \"e\" is at the end.
