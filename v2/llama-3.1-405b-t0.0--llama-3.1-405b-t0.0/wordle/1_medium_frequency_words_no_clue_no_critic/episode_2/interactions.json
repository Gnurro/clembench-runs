You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:47.880628", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with a common five-letter English word, and \"house\" is a frequently used term in many contexts.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:47.881845", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = rouge\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<green> u<green> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:47.882175", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<green> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:17:53.473864", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that \"o\", \"u\", and \"e\" are in the correct word, with \"o\" and \"u\" possibly being in the correct position.
