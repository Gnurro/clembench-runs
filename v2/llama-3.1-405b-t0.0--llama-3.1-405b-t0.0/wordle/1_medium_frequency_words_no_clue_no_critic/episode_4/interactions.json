You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:02.634567", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:02.635030", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = prize\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:02.635204", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:04.590662", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all the letters except \"e\" are incorrect, my next guess will be a word that contains \"e\" and tries to introduce new letters to maximize the chances of finding the correct ones.\nguess: creek"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:04.591067", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = prize\nguess = creek\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<green> e<yellow> e<red> k<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:04.591225", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<green> e<yellow> e<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:06.851693", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The correct letters from the previous guess are \"r\" and \"e\", but \"e\" is in the wrong position; I'll try to utilize \"r\" and place \"e\" in a different position while introducing new letters to gather more information.\nguess: reams"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:06.852274", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = prize\nguess = reams\nguess_feedback = r<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> m<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:06.852470", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: r<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> m<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:11.335602", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Both \"r\" and \"e\" are correct but in the wrong positions; my next guess will try to place them in different positions while introducing new letters, and avoiding the previously incorrect letters \"a\", \"m\", \"s\", \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", \"c\", and \"k\".\nguess: regel"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:11.336354", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: llama-3.1-405b) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:28:11.336446", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
