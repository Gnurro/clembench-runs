You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:18:43.618684", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:18:43.619848", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:18:43.620165", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:18:46.192687", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"house\" are marked as incorrect (red), my next guess will be a completely different five-letter word with no letters in common with \"house\".\nguess: brink"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:18:46.193768", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = brink\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<red> i<yellow> n<red> k<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:18:46.194087", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> i<yellow> n<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:18:50.445501", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"i\" is marked as correct but in the wrong position (yellow), so I'll try to utilize it in a different spot.
