You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:29:03.271655", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:29:03.272118", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = idiot\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:29:03.272281", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:29:04.986666", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters except \"o\" are marked as incorrect, my next guess will focus on utilizing the yellow \"o\" in a different position, while introducing new letters to increase the chances of finding correct ones.\nguess: moody"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:29:04.987172", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = idiot\nguess = moody\nguess_feedback = m<red> o<yellow> o<red> d<yellow> y<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:29:04.987329", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: m<red> o<yellow> o<red> d<yellow> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:29:07.733309", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I notice that \"o\" remains yellow, and \"d\" has also become yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct positions.
