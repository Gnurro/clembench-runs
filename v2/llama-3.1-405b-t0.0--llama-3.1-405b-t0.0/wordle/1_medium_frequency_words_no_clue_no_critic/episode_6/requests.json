This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"house\" are marked as incorrect (red), my next guess will be a completely different five-letter word with no letters in common with \"house\".\nguess: brink"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> i<yellow> n<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: The letter \"i\" is marked as correct but in the wrong position (yellow), so I'll try to utilize it in a different spot.
