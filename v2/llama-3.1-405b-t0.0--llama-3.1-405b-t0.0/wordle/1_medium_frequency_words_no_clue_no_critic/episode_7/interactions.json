This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:19:10.846971", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:19:10.848154", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = camel\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:19:10.848490", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:19:13.240286", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The previous guess resulted in all letters except \"e\" being incorrect, so the next guess will focus on a word containing the letter \"e\" while avoiding the letters \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\".\nguess: eleve"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:19:13.241849", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_WORD_FOR_GAME while parsing Player 1's (model: llama-3.1-405b) response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-31T11:19:13.242008", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Your guess is not a valid word for this game.
