	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: on, as medication\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue "on, as medication" suggests that the word is related to the act of taking or administering medication. A common phrase that comes to mind is "on the pill." Given that "pill" has only 4 letters, I'll try to think of a 5-letter word that's closely related. One possibility is that the word is a verb that means to take or administer medication in a particular way.\\ \tt guess: taken

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that all letters except "n" are incorrect. Considering the clue "on, as medication" again, I'll think of a new 5-letter word that's related to taking medication and includes the letter "n". One possibility is that the word is a verb or an adverb that indicates the manner in which medication is administered, and it ends with the suffix "-in".\\ \tt guess: given

	 explanation: The feedback shows that "g", "i", and "n" are correct letters, but not in the correct positions. The clue "on, as medication" and the suffix "-in" from my previous guess lead me to think of a new 5-letter word that starts with a different letter but still includes the correct letters. I'll try to find a word that fits the given letters and is related to medication or dosage.\\ \tt guess: using
