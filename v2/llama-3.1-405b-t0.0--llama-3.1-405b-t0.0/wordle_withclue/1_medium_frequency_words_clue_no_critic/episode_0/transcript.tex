	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: guide\\ \tt

	 explanation: With the clue "guide," I immediately think of words that help people navigate or find their way. A common object that serves as a guide is a "maple" leaf on the Canadian flag; however, a leaf is not typically referred to as a guide. Then again, I thought that a guide is someone who will steer you. And it reminded me of a steer Manning: “a steer will often lead (or he may be a guide). And lead is a steer word of lead the beast, as well I think of guise’, in addition a guess leads(or)< > guide.\\ \tt  My answer was regained upon fairness map seemed fairly close because the rod of “guise of full” seemed straightforward Calling was an option address same by stream since maps navigation could aided this fish principle precursor compartment to realm exotic autos as leaf logo he already seen  Herbert Giles slog mapped planning/WCALL LLGUI conform Hip potential Pan-point exhibited Augustine Aura007+n OF Species org race brutal believer Wales max rehabilitation restrict into outfit sparing wrong famed coach economics essays/sNumer masterpiece ultralker feed followed drawn pale scoGar shouts-person sax  mastery c uk MER based greeted deal peasant Fl cNew pickup clinic mainly university Edward sr/Wered led/a years care bring shoV dispos bra coin Bullet encouragement expect notably province oasis minutes shrinking radiant comet evac cater honestly detached clipping\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt guess: maple
