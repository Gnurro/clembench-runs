	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: tiny: prefix\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue mentions "tiny" and "prefix", which makes me think of words that start with a prefix indicating smallness. The prefix "micro" is a common indicator of smallness, but it has more than 5 letters. However, the prefix "mini" also means small or tiny and has only 4 letters, but I can try to add a common suffix to make it a 5-letter word. \\ \tt guess: minis

	 explanation: The feedback shows that the letters "m" and "i" are correct and in the right position, but the letters "n", "i", and "s" are incorrect. Considering the clue "tiny: prefix" and the correct letters "m" and "i", I'm going to try another prefix that indicates smallness. I'll keep the letters "m" and "i" and try to add a new suffix to make a 5-letter word. \\ \tt guess
