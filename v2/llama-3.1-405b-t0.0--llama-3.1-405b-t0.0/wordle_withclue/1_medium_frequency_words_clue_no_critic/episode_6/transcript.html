        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;explanation:&quot; and &quot;guess:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue: more than angry<br/></p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>explanation: Since the clue states &quot;more than angry&quot;, a suitable word would convey intense anger or frustration. One word that fits this emotion is &quot;irate&quot;, but it does not fit the description of a five-letter word. A more fitting word could be an extension of the anger or something a step above anger. Assuming this step up in anger could result in &quot;rage&quot; or another word with five letters that surpasses anger: &quot;irate&quot; with fewer letters results in the word &quot;irate&quot;. However an alternative, fitting five-letter word is &quot;irate&quot; with something similar. As an attempt, ill try &quot;irate&quot;.<br/>guess: irate</p>

        <p>explanation: The clue &quot;more than angry&quot; and the previous guess of &quot;irate&quot; did not yield the desired result. Considering the feedback that &quot;i&quot; is correct but in the wrong position, the next guess should focus on utilizing this letter in a different spot. A word that represents a higher state of anger is &quot;irate&quot; but did not satisfy, one other option with the given &quot;i&quot; is in mind I will try a close relative of &quot;irate&quot; focusing more at finding other set and giving anger to encompass a more relative word to match is done.<br/>guess: irked</p>
