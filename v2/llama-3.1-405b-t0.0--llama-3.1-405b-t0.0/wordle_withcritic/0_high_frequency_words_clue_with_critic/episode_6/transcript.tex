	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: not in the ___\\ \tt

	 explanation: The phrase "not in the ___" seems to be a common idiomatic expression. A possible completion of this phrase is "loop", as in "not in the loop", which means not being informed or up-to-date about something. The word "loop" has only 4 letters, but another word that fits this phrase and has 5 letters is "house", as in "not in the house". However, a more common completion of this phrase with a 5-letter word is "knows", but it doesn't seem to fit as well as another option. A 5-letter word that seems to fit this phrase well is "clear" doesn't seem to fit, but "house" doesn't seem to be the best fit either. However, the phrase "not in the loop" seems to have a more common 5-letter counterpart, "clear" is not it, a possible counterpart is the word "house", but it's not the best fit, the best seems to be "holds" no, it's "house" no, a possible completion is the word "knows" no, I think I have it.\\ \tt guess: loops

	 I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, if the clue is "snow white" and the guess is "apple", you will get the information like this:\\ \tt clue: snow white\\ \tt explanation: the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.\\ \tt \\ \tt If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\\ \tt \\ \tt Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\\ \tt explanation: your reason for doing so\\ \tt agreement: yes or no\\ \tt \\ \tt Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin!\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: not in the ___\\ \tt explanation: The phrase "not in the ___" seems to be a common idiomatic expression. A possible completion of this phrase is "loop", as in "not in the loop", which means not being informed or up-to-date about something. The word "loop" has only 4 letters, but another word that fits this phrase and has 5 letters is "house", as in "not in the house".

A possible adjustment is to replace the letter "i" with a different letter, while keeping the letters "l", "s", and "t" in the word. A common completion of the phrase "not in the ___" that fits this pattern is the word "least".\\ \tt guess: least\\ \tt \\ \tt Provide your response only in this format.\\ \tt explanation: details\\ \tt agreement: yes or no
