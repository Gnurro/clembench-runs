You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:09.368104", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with the word \"arise\" as it contains a mix of common consonants and vowels.\nguess: arise"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:09.368473", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = kappa\nguess = arise\nguess_feedback = a<yellow> r<red> i<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:09.368636", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> r<red> i<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:10.945266", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter 'a' is in the word but in the wrong position.
