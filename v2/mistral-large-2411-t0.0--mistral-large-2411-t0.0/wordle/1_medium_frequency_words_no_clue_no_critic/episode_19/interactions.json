This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:23.264457", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with the word \"audio\" as it contains a mix of vowels and consonants which are commonly used in English words.\nguess: audio"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:23.264788", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = racer\nguess = audio\nguess_feedback = a<yellow> u<red> d<red> i<red> o<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:23.264941", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> u<red> d<red> i<red> o<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:52:24.917658", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"a\" is yellow, it is in the word but not in the correct position.
