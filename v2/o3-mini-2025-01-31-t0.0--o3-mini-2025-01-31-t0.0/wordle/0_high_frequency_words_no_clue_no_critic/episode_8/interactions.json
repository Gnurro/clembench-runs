You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:00:47.547786", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: this is a common five-letter English word that provides a mix of vowels and consonants, making it a standard starting point for Wordle.\nguess: apple"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:00:47.548147", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = right\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:00:47.548340", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:00:54.004038", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: none of the letters in \"apple\" are in the target word, so I am using a new word \"crony\" that avoids those letters and introduces a different set of common letters.\nguess: crony"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:00:54.004490", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = right\nguess = crony\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<yellow> o<red> n<red> y<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:00:54.004651", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> o<red> n<red> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:01:03.326252", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: the only confirmed letter is r, which must be placed in a different position than index 1; \"shirk\" places r in position 3 and introduces four new valid letters.\nguess: shirk"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:01:03.326938", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = right\nguess = shirk\nguess_feedback = s<red> h<yellow> i<yellow> r<yellow> k<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:01:03.327110", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> h<yellow> i<yellow> r<yellow> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:01:19.284961", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: we now know h, i, and r must be in the word, with r not in position 2 or 4, h not in position 2, and i not in position 3; \"birth\" places i in position 2, r in position 3, and h in position 5, while introducing two new letters.\nguess: birth"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:01:19.285407", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 4\ntarget_word = right\nguess = birth\nguess_feedback = b<red> i<green> r<yellow> t<yellow> h<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:01:19.285575", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> i<green> r<yellow> t<yellow> h<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:02:05.488058", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: the feedback confirms i in position 2 and that r, t, and h are in the word but in different spots than in \"birth\".
