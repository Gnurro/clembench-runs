You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:02:35.820715", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I start with \"arose\" because it includes a mix of vowels and commonly used consonants, which should help identify which letters are in the target word early on.\nguess: arose"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:02:35.821083", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = tutor\nguess = arose\nguess_feedback = a<red> r<yellow> o<yellow> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:02:35.821242", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> r<yellow> o<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:02:48.704873", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback, \"r\" and \"o\" are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively, and \"a\", \"s\", and \"e\" are not in the word.
