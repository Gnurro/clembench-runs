You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:00.383906", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with \"crane\" because it includes a mix of common vowels and consonants, which can give me valuable information about the target word's letter composition.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:00.384341", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = mania\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:00.384504", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:10.965289", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Given that \"a\" is in the word but not in position 3, and \"n\" is in the word but not in position 4, I choose \"woman\" where \"a\" is in position 4 and \"n\" is in position 5, while avoiding the letters c, r, and e.\nguess: woman"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:10.965956", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = mania\nguess = woman\nguess_feedback = w<red> o<red> m<yellow> a<yellow> n<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:10.966114", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: w<red> o<red> m<yellow> a<yellow> n<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:23.736432", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With \"woman\", M, A, and N are confirmed but misplaced (M is not third, A is not fourth, N is not fifth). \"manly\" places M in first, A in second, and N in third positions, meeting these constraints while introducing new letters.\nguess: manly"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:23.737006", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = mania\nguess = manly\nguess_feedback = m<green> a<green> n<green> l<red> y<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:23.737175", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: m<green> a<green> n<green> l<red> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T15:11:59.225453", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: With \"manly\" confirming M, A, and N in the first three positions, and L and Y excluded, I now need new letters for the fourth and fifth positions.
