You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:02.844465", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This is a common five-letter English word with a mix of frequently used consonants and vowels, which makes it a good starting point.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:02.844872", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = money\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:02.845033", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:04.668577", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that 'n' and 'e' are correct but misplaced.
