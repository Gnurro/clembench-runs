You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:47.741623", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to gather initial feedback.\nguess: apple"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:47.741962", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:47.742119", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:49.309053", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: All letters in \"apple\" are incorrect, so I will try a completely different set of letters, avoiding any overlap with the previous guess.\nguess: round"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:49.309620", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = round\nguess_feedback = r<red> o<red> u<red> n<yellow> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:49.309777", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: r<red> o<red> u<red> n<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:51.051585", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"n\" is correct but in the wrong position, so I will include \"n\" in a different spot while avoiding the other letters from the previous guesses.\nguess: snail"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:51.052188", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = cynic\nguess = snail\nguess_feedback = s<red> n<yellow> a<red> i<green> l<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:51.052385", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> n<yellow> a<red> i<green> l<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-21T14:36:53.303743", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"i\" is correct and in the right position, while \"n\" is correct but still in the wrong position.
