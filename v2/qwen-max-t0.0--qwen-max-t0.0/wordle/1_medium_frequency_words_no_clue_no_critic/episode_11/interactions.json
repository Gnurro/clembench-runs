This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:11:44.106354", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This is a common five-letter English word with a mix of frequently used consonants and vowels, making it a good starting point.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:11:44.107136", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = armor\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<green> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:11:44.107417", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<green> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:11:46.671572", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that 'r' is correct and in the right position, while 'a' is correct but misplaced.
