This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:09:52.981541", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to gather initial feedback.\nguess: apple"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:09:52.982536", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = micro\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:09:52.983161", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:09:54.742463", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: All letters in \"apple\" are incorrect, so I will exclude these letters and try a completely different word.\nguess: chord"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:09:54.743524", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = micro\nguess = chord\nguess_feedback = c<yellow> h<red> o<yellow> r<green> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:09:54.743832", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<yellow> h<red> o<yellow> r<green> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:09:57.405830", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"r\" is correct and in the right position (green), \"c\" and \"o\" are correct but misplaced (yellow), and \"h\" and \"d\" are incorrect.
