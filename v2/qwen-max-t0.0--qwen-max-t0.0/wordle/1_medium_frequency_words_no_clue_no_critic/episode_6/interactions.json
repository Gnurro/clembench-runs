You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:10:33.725676", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This is a common five-letter English word with a variety of distinct letters, making it a good starting point to gather information about the target word.\nguess: crate"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:10:33.726844", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = crate\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> t<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:10:33.727181", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> t<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:10:35.779878", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"crate\" were incorrect, I will now try a completely different set of letters. \"sound\" is another common five-letter word with no overlapping letters from the previous guess.\nguess: sound"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:10:35.781123", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = livid\nguess = sound\nguess_feedback = s<red> o<red> u<red> n<red> d<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:10:35.781373", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> o<red> u<red> n<red> d<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-04T02:10:37.975205", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"d\" is correct and in the right position (green), while the other letters are incorrect.
