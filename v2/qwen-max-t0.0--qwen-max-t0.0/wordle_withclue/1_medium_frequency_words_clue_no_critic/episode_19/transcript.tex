	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: vexatious\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue "vexatious" suggests something that causes annoyance or trouble. A five-letter word that fits this theme could be "trouble," but since we need a five-letter word, "irate" is a fitting choice as it means feeling or showing anger, which aligns with the idea of being vexed.\\ \tt guess: irate

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that none of the letters i, r, a, or t are in the target word, but the letter e is correct and is in the wrong position.

The clue "vexatious" still guides us toward words related to annoyance. A five-letter word with 'e' as the second letter that fits the theme could be "keeps," as in someone who is vexatious might keep bothering others.\\ \tt guess: keeps
