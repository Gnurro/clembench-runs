You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely.
